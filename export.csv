Christopher,Smith,Instructional Assistant Professor,"My graduate research primarily revolved around using microscopic organisms called foraminifera as environmental indicators, using both microfossils and extant groups in the present day. Foraminifera are extraordinarily sensitive to environmental changes, which makes them a potentially valuable tool in a wide array of research avenues.<br /><br />Under Dr. Susan Goldstein at the University of Georgia, my doctoral project involved the effect of heavy metals such as arsenic, cadmium, copper, nickel, and zinc on foraminifera. Because foraminifera are so sensitive to environmental shifts in everything from temperature to salinity to pH, it can be historically hard to ascertain the specific effects of heavy metals and other pollutants on foraminifera. Specifically, it is not known if there is a major difference in how these elements affect foraminifera. In addition, it is unclear whether different clades of foraminifera respond to heavy metal influence in the same fashion. The goal of this study was to enhance the utility of foraminifera as bioindicators by seeking answers to these questions so that potential bioindicator species might be confirmed. To do this, I used a technique pioneered by Dr. Goldstein and Dr. Elisabeth Alve that involves the harvesting of propagules. Propagules are juvenile foraminifera present in aquatic sediment. By sieving out everything except the smallest possible fraction, the propagules can be isolated and placed in conditions of the researcher's choosing. Sediment samples were taken from two different coastal sites: Sapelo Island, Georgia, and Little Duck Key, Florida. Using the propagule method, assemblages of foraminifera were grown in the laboratory from propagules in the sediment samples, with exposure to selected individual heavy metals. The metals had an overall negative effect on the population dynamics and shell chemistry of foraminifera. Zinc in particular seems to cause shell deformities in certain species at elevated concentrations. This research also used laser ablation ICP-MS to explore possible incorporation of the metals into the foraminiferal shell itself. Using facilities at Oregon State University, LA-ICP-MS revealed that the vast majority of foraminifera incorporated the surrounding heavy metals in the water into their tests. The amount of metal incorporated seemed to depend on the species and metal involved, revealing possible vital effects at work governing biochemical reactions between the foraminifera and the elements in the seawater. This doctoral project resulted in three professional papers, all three of which are published, with two in the Journal of Foraminiferal Research and one in Marine Micropaleontology.",Instructional Assistant Professor,Marine and Coastal Environmental Science,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n01f48ad9

Zhilong,Yang,Associate Professor,"The overarching research goal of the Yang laboratory is to understand the mechanisms governing viral replication, with the rationale that the discoveries will expand the knowledge of both viruses and their hosts, and facilitate the development of novel strategies to combat viral and non-viral diseases. A parallel goal of Yang lab is to provide a highly supportive environment to train the next generations of scientists. The ongoing research focuses on how viruses interact with two cellular housekeeping processes: protein synthesis and metabolism using vaccinia virus as the research model. Vaccinia virus is the prototype poxvirus. Poxviruses significantly impact public health, with many presently causing morbidity and mortality in humans and many economically important animals, including deadly zoonotic pathogens (e.g., monkeypox virus). In addition, despite the eradication of smallpox, one of the most (if not the most) devastating diseases in human history, smallpox resurgence remains a serious biothreat. Poxviruses are also widely developed as veterinary and human vaccine vectors and as cancer treatment agents. Poxviruses provide numerous precious tools to understand many aspects of cell biology and dissect complex life processes, as their large DNA genomes encode hundreds of genes that engage many key nodes of cellular life. Yang's research integrates biochemical, molecular, and omics  approaches. Taking advantage of their in-depth knowledge of the poxvirus replication and virus-host interactions, the Yang lab also develops vaccinia virus-based utilities and anti-virals.",Associate Professor,Veterinary Pathobiology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n02daa01b

Vishal,Gohil,Associate Professor,"Despite the fundamental role of the mitochondrion in cellular energy production and its involvement in numerous human diseases, we still do not know the function of nearly 20% of the known mitochondrial proteins. My laboratory applies genomic, genetic, and biochemical tools to uncover the role of these uncharacterized proteins in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) biogenesis. MRC is the main site of cellular respiration and energy production and since the core components of the MRC are evolutionarily conserved, we reason that the assembly factors required to build the MRC should also be conserved. Therefore, we utilize multiple models systems, including yeast, zebrafish, and human cell lines, to determine the role of these conserved, uncharacterized mitochondrial proteins in bioenergetics, organismal development, and human disease pathogenesis.<br /><br /><br /><br />Another poorly understood aspect of the mitochondrial energy metabolism is the role of phospholipids in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the MRC. Although it is well known that the MRC is localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane, how the unique lipid milieu of the mitochondrial membrane influences the assembly and activity of the MRC is not fully understood. We have constructed yeast mutants with defined mitochondrial phospholipid compositions to systematically determine each lipid's role in MRC assembly and activity. Ultimately, defining the roles of mitochondrial proteins and phospholipids will allow us to develop better diagnostic and therapeutic options for human disorders resulting from mitochondrial dysfunction.",Faculty Affiliate||Assistant Professor,Energy Institute||Biochemistry and Biophysics,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n03100e49

Donald,Darensbourg,Distinguished Professor,"The fundamentally interesting and challenging chemistry associated with carbon dioxide, coupled with its high potential as a source of chemical carbon, provides adequate justification for comprehensive investigations in this area. In our research program we have attempted to establish a clearer mechanistic view of carbon-hydrogen, carbon-carbon, and carbon-oxygen bond forming processes resulting from carbon dioxide insertion into M-H, M-C, and M-O bonds.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant to the latter process our research has addressed the utilization of carbon dioxide in the development of improved synthetic routes for the production of polycarbonates. The hazardous and expensive production process currently in place industrially for these materials involves the interfacial polycondensation of phosgene and diols, accentuates the need for these studies. Although we and others have made significant advances in the synthesis of these useful thermoplastics from carbon dioxide and epoxides much of the fundamental knowledge concerning the reaction kinetics of these processes is lacking, due in part to the practical challenges associated with sampling and analyzing systems at elevated temperatures and pressures. This information is needed for making this process applicable to the synthesis of a variety of copolymers possessing a range of properties and uses. Our studies are examining in detail the mechanistic aspects of metal catalyzed carbon dioxide/epoxide coupling reactions employing in situ spectroscopy methods. For this purpose Fourier-transform infrared attenuated total refluctance (FTIR/ATR) spectroscopy is being utilized. Other related investigations involve the development of structural and reactivity models for the industrially prevalent double metal cyanide catalysts(DMC) used in polyethers and polycarbonate synthesis from epoxides or CO2/epoxides, respectively.",Distinguished Professor||Faculty Affiliate,Energy Institute||Chemistry,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n06bf3bf8

Dorothy,Shippen,Professor,"We are taking biochemical, molecular genetic and cytological approaches to study the structure, function and maintenance of telomeres. Telomeres are higher order nucleoprotein complexes that cap the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes and play essential roles in conferring genome stability and cell proliferation capacity. The protective cap of the telomere is comprised of specific telomere binding proteins that regulate the length of telomeric DNA tract and allow the cell distinguish the chromosome terminus from a double-strand break. Telomeric DNA is synthesized by the action of telomerase, an unusual reverse transcriptase that replenishes telomeric DNA lost as a consequence of replication by conventional DNA polymerases. We have developed the genetically tractable flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana as a model system for studying telomeres in higher eukaryotes. With its sequenced genome, abundant genetic and transgenic tools, and extraordinarily high tolerance to genome instability, Arabidopsis has proven to be an excellent model for investigating fundamental processes in telomere biology.

Robert,Lucchese,Professor,"We study various processes which involve electrons being scattered by or ejected from molecules. These processes include ectron-molecule collision, electron impact ionization, and photoionization. Recently we have worked closely with experimental groups around the world to study molecular frame photoelectron angular distributions. In these studies we can make detailed comparisons of experimental data and theoretical predictions of the probability of the emission of the photoelectron in specific directions relative to the orientation of the molecule. We have also considered electron scattering from cage molecules such as C60 and C20. In these systems we have found a new class of scattering resonances where the electron is trapped inside the cage. These processes are important in such physical systems as upper atmospheres, plasma processing of semiconductors, and surface analysis.<br /><br /><br /><br />A second area of interest is the structure and dynamics of hydrogen bonded clusters. This work is done in collaboration with Professor J. W. Bevan's research group where the corresponding systems are studied experimentally. We develop potential energy surfaces using both experimental data and by performing quantum mechanical electronic structure calculations. These potentials are then used in quantum mechanical calculations of the vibrational motion of the complexes with particular attention being focused on the large amplitude motion found in hydrogen bonded systems.

My lab was the first to demonstrate that Sgg actively promotes the development of colon tumors, elevating a long-stranding clinical association to a functional causal role of Sgg in tumor development. Despite its medical importance, the pathogenic mechanism of Sgg remains poorly understood. Our recent studies have demonstrated that a type VII secretion system of Sgg plays a key role in pathogenesis.

Marlene,Dixon,Professor,"My research focuses on relationships between sport and life quality. Since the capacity of sport to deliver socially valued outcomes (e.g., health, well-being, sense of community, economic development) depends on the nature of sport program content and delivery, my work endeavors to identify how sport can be designed, managed, and marketed to promote and enhance the life quality of individuals, families, and communities.  Using a human resource management and systems approach, my research has examined the micro (employee, participant), meso (organizational), and macro (delivery system) elements of sport that illumine relationships between the ways that sport programs and systems are designed and implemented, on the one hand, and their consequent outcomes, on the other.  Normatively, these findings also bear implications for modification of sport programs and systems.  Thus, my work has two goals:  (1) to formulate a model that describes and explains relations between the characteristics of sport programs and systems and their consequent effects on the lives of those who provide or who do sport, and (2) to thereby enable formulation, management, and marketing of sport programs that consistently and effectively add value to the lives of individuals, families, the communities in which they live.",Professor,Kinesiology and Sport Management,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n0cbb0886

Bruce,Riley,Professor,"My lab studies inner ear development in zebrafish. A prominent feature of our research is to investigate how cell-cell signaling and downstream gene-interactions control development.  One project in the lab focuses on how cell signaling regulates ectodermal patterning during gastrulation to establish the otic placode, the precursor of the inner ear.  Our recent work shows that localized Fgf signaling is especially critical for inducing formation of the otic placode, and members of the Pax2/5/8 family of transcription factors are important mediators of Fgf signaling.  During later stages of inner ear development, we are exploring how sensory hair cells and neurons are regulated.  Our studies address how these cells initially form, how they are genetically maintained, and how they become specialized for hearing vs. balance.  We are also investigating how zebrafish can replace dead and damaged hair cells, an ability that mammals have lost.  The inability to regenerate hair cells explains why humans show progressive irreversible hearing loss as we age.  It is hoped that activating or augmenting human homologs of genes shown to operate in zebrafish might help restore hearing and balance in humans.",Professor,Biology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n0dbb8253

Timothy,Devarenne,Associate Professor,"We study the biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying the control of programmed cell death (PCD) in plants and how PCD is manipulated during plant-pathogen interactions. Specifically we study the interaction between tomato and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) the causative agent of bacterial spot disease. Resistance to this disease is conferred by the host Pto serine/threonine protein kinase which recognizes Pst strains expressing the type III effector protein AvrPto.<br /><br />PCD is induced during both resistant and susceptible plant-pathogen interactions. In the case of a resistant interaction, PCD induced by the plant, known as the hypersensitive response (HR), and acts to limit the spread of the pathogen. In susceptible plant-pathogen interactions plant PCD is induced by the pathogen after infection leading to death of the host. Studies have indicated that the genes controlling host PCD during the HR are the same genes that are manipulated by the pathogen during susceptible interactions. The difference lies in the timing of controlling the activity of these genes; HR PCD occurs within 12 hours of pathogen recognition while pathogen-induced PCD occurs several days after infection.<br /><br /><br /><br />Many of these genes that control plant PCD are serine/threonine (S/T) protein kinase. We are interested in studying a specific class of S/T protein kinases that control PCD in plants called AGC kinases and how they are regulated in both resistant and susceptible plant-pathogen interactions. Additionally, when plants are not attacked by pathogens, PCD is a process that requires constant control so that cell death does not occur. We are looking at the signaling mechanisms and pathways employed to keep PCD under check in non-pathogen challenged plants.",Faculty Affiliate||Associate Professor,Energy Institute||Biochemistry and Biophysics,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n11411275

The current main research effort in our lab is to understand. Cilia and flagella are microtubule-based appendages extending from the basal body of almost all eukaryotic cells, and are classified as either motile or primary. Motile cilia or flagella such as Chlamydomonas flagella, sperm flagella and respiratory tract epithelial cell cilia are responsible for movement or generation of fluid flow.  In contrast, primary cilia are non-motile organelles that are critically involved in visual, olfactory and auditory signal transduction and play key roles in regulation of gene expression, development and animal behavior.  Ciliary defects are linked to ciliopathies such as polycystic kidney disease, nephronophthisis, retinal degeneration, situs inversus, hydrocephalus, polydactyly and obesity. Our lab uses a combination of biochemistry, cell biology, and genetics approaches to understand the principles of ciliogenesis and its regulation.<br /><br /><br /><br />Flagellar axoneme structure and motility<br /><br />The waveform of cilia is conserved, no matter whether the cilia are on green algae Chlamydomonas or mammalian epithelia found in the airways, the uterus and fallopian tubes, the efferent ducts of the testes, and the ventricular system of the brain.

Rodolfo,Aramayo,Associate Professor,"The main subject of my research is to understand how Information is organized, distributed and compared in Biological Systems. We are specially fascinated by the possibility that the information present in DNA, RNA and Proteins can be digitalized. The process of converting information (i.e., different biological features) into their digital equivalents has the potential, we hypothesize, of simplifying the genome information as to allow us to uncover previously undetected informational patterns, while performing these complex computational comparisons with little effort. We call this new field: Digital Biology.<br /><br />To test the viability of Digital Biology, we have recently developed a series of computational algorithms aimed at extracting and classifying the informational content present genomes (i.e., extracting their informasomes). Once digitalized, informasomes can then be easily compared in a computationally-efficient manner.<br /><br />Digital Biology offers a new way to re-analyze an old problem, while potentially uncovering previously undetected informational patterns. It allows for the study of evolution from an informational-, not sequence-based point of view. This approach, has already allowed us to detect unexpected informational patterns present in the chromosomes of all organisms.<br /><br />We believe that this approach will both simplify and amplify our ability to understand not only genome evolution, but also the field of comparative genomics. Although our initial work is being performed with animal genomes, we plan on to extend this powerful approach to the analysis of fungal, plants, and bacterial genomes. <br /><br />Our Digital Biology work ideas emerged from my discovery of Meiotic Silencing in Neurospora crassa.  Meiotic Silencing, are one of the most unusual, amazing and intriguing mechanisms observed in meiotic cells of eukaryotic organisms.  Meiotic Silencing compares the information present in opposite homologous chromosomes in meiosis. Here, if a DNA segment is absent or highly mutated on the opposite homologous chromosome, the resulting ""unpaired"" DNA segment is targeted for silencing. This triggers the generation of small RNAs with homology to the affected region. These small RNAs, in turn, proceed to destroy mRNAs that have homology to the ""unpaired"" DNA region.",Associate Professor,Biology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n14287b36

Rachel,Smallman,Associate Professor,"Our research focuses on the social cognitive processes involved in decision-making. Our primary research focuses on counterfactual thinking, which are thoughts of ""if only"" or ""what might have been"". Imagining how events might have turned out differently is a common cognitive process, especially after negative events and near misses. Research shows that these counterfactual thoughts can be both dysfunctional and functional, depending on the situation. Our research examines both sides of the counterfactual coin: the bias and the benefits of counterfactual thinking. We are particularly interested in how and why these thoughts occur and their affective, cognitive, and behavioral consequences. Importantly our current projects examine both the basic science behind counterfactual thinking and also how it can be applied to both mental health and health behavior domains. Other research in the lab examines various factors involved in decision-making, with interdisciplinary work examining decision-making and motivation in engineering.",Associate Professor,,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n164f5f26

Lanying,Zeng,Professor,"Living systems make decisions by integrating information from their environments in order to optimize their own fitness. This decision-making process has many intricacies, with a dual nature characterized by stochasticity and determinism, and considerable effort has been dedicated to characterizing the factors contributing to cell-fate heterogeneity. Our primary goal is to determine how multiple environmental and genetic factors, some deterministic and some stochastic, impact developmental outcomes. We choose to study paradigms of cellular decision-making such as bacteriophage lambda lytic-lysogenic development to simplify the complicated nature of cell-fate selection. By distilling the study of a ubiquitous and vital process into basic questions, we hope to generate new insights into how decision-making affects cellular development and differentiation in higher organisms.<br /><br /><br /><br />We utilize high-resolution live-cell fluorescence microscopy, single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, quantitative data analysis, and simple mathematical modeling to mechanistically dissect the decision-making processes at single-cell/molecule levels. Our favorite biological models are the lysis-lysogeny systems of bacteria and their viruses, like E. coli being infected by paradigm phages lambda and P1.

Sandun,Fernando,Professor,"Progression of chemical reactions often requires the presence of a substance called a catalyst that selectively accelerates the desired reaction(s) without itself being consumed. In this regard, enzyme catalysts are very selective towards specific reactions. However, their ability to tolerate a wide range of reaction conditions is poor. On the other hand, non-enzymatic catalysts (inorganic and organic) are robust and tolerant to a wide range of conditions, but they are not very selective. The long-term goal of my research program is to integrate (marry) desirable traits of both these catalysis systems in order to develop catalytic systems with novel functionalities.",Faculty Affiliate||Professor,Biological and Agricultural Engineering||Energy Institute,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n1b70c743

Aberrant levels of PKC expression or activity have been implicated in a large number of human diseases, such as cancer, cardiac failure, Alzheimer's disease, and diabetes.

Sarbajit,Banerjee,Professor,"Much of our research program is directed at understanding the interplay between geometric and electronic structure at interfaces as well as in solid-state materials and to examine how this translates to functional properties. Our research thus spans the range from materials synthesis, mechanistic understanding of crystal growth processes, and structural characterization to device integration and mechanistic studies of catalysis and intercalation phenomena. We further seek to translate fundamental understanding of interfaces and materials to develop functional thin films and devices for a wide range of applications ranging from Mott memory to thermochromic window coatings and thin films for the corrosion protection of steel.",Professor||Faculty Fellow||Faculty Affiliate,Center for Health Systems and Design||Energy Institute||Chemistry,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n1fff3688

Xiuren,Zhang,Professor,"Our laboratory focuses on systemic analysis of biochemical, molecular and biological functions of AGO family proteins (AGOs-mics) in genetically tractable Arabidopsis and economically important crops (i.e. rice). We'd like to identify the small RNAs, mRNA targets and protein components which associate with these AGOs. We will study protein/RNA and protein/protein interactions in these RISC assembly events. Our goal is to understand how these AGOs are functionally specialized or redundant corresponding to endogenous development cues and external environmental stimuli. Particularly, we'd like to learn how plants reprogram their gene expression through the small RNAs and AGOs to construct a new cellular niche in responses to environmental challenges and biotic stresses.<br /><br /><br /><br />Another aspect of our research involves host/virus interaction. Plants take advantage of RNA silencing pathways to defend themselves from exogenous nucleic acid invaders (i.e. viruses). As an anti-host defense mechanism, viruses encode suppressors that can block RNA silencing responses. We have recently demonstrated that CMV 2b disables AGO1 cleavage activity to inhibit RNA silencing and to counter host defense. We are now extending our study to suppressors of several other viruses and the molecular mechanisms of their suppression.",Associate Professor,Biochemistry and Biophysics,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n220933ad

In particular, I am interested in identifying (a) the ways in which cortical pathways for language processing are influenced by systematic differences in early language experience (e.g., bilingualism) and (b) how these pathway differences relate to executive functions over the lifespan (e.g., the robustness of working memory).  Health-related effects of cognitive decline cost the health care system millions of dollars each year, but new research suggests that certain kinds of bilingualism may defend the brain from age-related cognitive losses.  However, very little is known about the neural substrates that may underlie this defense.  The rationale of my research program is that identification of the neural mechanisms associated with different language histories will lay the groundwork for investigating precisely whether and how bilingualism is uniquely associated with a reduction in age-related cognitive decline.",Lecturer,,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n225e1e9d

Emile,Schweikert,Professor,"Our research explores the extreme limits of analytical chemistry: the characterization of atto to zeptomole quantities of molecules. The aim is to detect such amounts of analyte within nanometric surface volumes. The goal is chemical imaging of surfaces with exquisite spatial resolution. The first challenge is to conceive methods and instrumentation for the accurate identification of as little as a few thousand molecules. The second challenge is to convert a measurement into analytical information. A measurement by itself, even a spectacular one such as detection of a single atom or molecule, is not sufficient. Measurements must be related to the physico-chemical system sampled in terms of concentration and/or spatiotemporal localization.<br /><br /><br /><br />Our experimental procedure is based on the desorption of atomic and molecular species when a solid is bombarded with energetic massive projectiles such as, for example, C60+ or Au4004+ . Their impact causes abundant emission of neutral and ionized atoms, molecules and molecular fragments. The desorbed ions are detected by time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The experimental procedure is that of secondary ion mass spectrometry with two innovations: the massive nature of the projectile and the mode of bombardment which is in a sequence of individual massive cluster impacts each isolated in time and space. Multiple ions can be ejected from a single impact. Given the size of the projectile (<= 3 nm in diameter), the co-ejected ions must originate from molecules colocated within nanometric dimensions.<br /><br /><br /><br />The new capabilities for detecting, localizing and tracking small numbers of molecules (10-18 to 10-21 moles) are tested on surfaces, membranes, and nano-objects selected for their relevance in catalysis, microelectronics, environmental and biomedical research.",Professor,Chemistry,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n233d0627

Although investigations of morphology, physiology, and behavior stand on their own, ultimately the integration of these studies can explain how organisms interact with their environment, the evolution of functional complexes, and the pressure selections involved in driving adaptations.",Professor||Professor,"Rangeland, Wildlife and Fisheries Management||Wildlife and Fisheries Sciences||Marine Biology",https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n27bd8535

David,Russell,Professor,"My research focuses on proteomics, lipidomics, biophysical chemistry and application and development of mass spectrometry, such as ""label-free"" nano-particle based biosensors and novel peptide/protein isolation and purification strategies. We are also investigating the structure(s) of model peptides in an effort to better describe folding/unfolding and structure of membrane and intrinsically disordered (IDP) proteins. Peptides take on very different 2?, 3? and 4? structure, which determine or influence bio-activity. In the presence of lipid vesicles peptides can exist as solution-phase species, ""absorbed"" on lipid bilayers or ""inserted"" (as a monomer or multimer) in lipid bilayers. By what mechanism do peptides interact with lipid membranes to affect these structural changes, how do peptide-lipid interactions promote self-assembly to form intermediates that eventually yield aggregates, i.e., amyloid fibrils, or how does metal ion coordination affect the structure of metalloproteins? Mass spectrometry-based experiments, hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange, chemical 'foot-printing' and gas-phase (ion-molecule and ion-ion reaction chemistry) and solution-phase chemical modifications, have expanded our abilities to address such questions, and new instrumental approaches, esp. ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) combined with enhanced molecular dynamics simulations (MDS), have become standard tools for structural-mass spectrometry studies. Over the past several years we have either acquired or developed novel, next-generation IM-MS instruments that are redefining cutting-edge structural-mass spectrometry research as well as cutting-edge computational tools essential to carry out these studies.

Deborah,Bell-Pedersen,Professor,"Research in the Bell-Pedersen lab focuses on determining how the circadian clock functions in organisms to regulate daily rhythms in gene expression, behavior, and physiology. The molecular clock in higher eukaryotes involves a master clock in the brain regulating clocks in peripheral tissues, posing significant obstacles for understanding circadian output mechanisms. Thus, a major strength of our work is using a single-celled model eukaryote, Neurospora crassa, to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of rhythmic gene expression and protein synthesis. Clock dysfunction in humans is associated with a wide range of diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, metabolic disorders, mental illness, sleep disorders, and aging. In addition, daily changes in metabolism and cell division rates influence the efficacy and toxicity of many pharmaceuticals, including cancer drugs. Therefore, knowing how clocks work to control rhythmic gene expression, and what they regulate, is critical for the development of therapeutics. Research to understand clock-controlled rhythmic gene expression has focused primarily on transcriptional mechanisms, and little was known about posttranscriptional control. We discovered that the clock regulates highly conserved translation initiation and elongation factors, tRNA synthetase levels, and ribosome heterogeneity. This regulation determines what mRNAs are rhythmically translated and the accuracy of the translation process (translation fidelity). We are capitalizing on these exciting discoveries to determine how the clock regulates translation fidelity. These studies will provide the foundation for understanding the impact of daily rhythms in translation fidelity on protein diversity beyond what is encoded for in the genome.",Professor and Associate Department Head,Biology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n2a2bfb97

Bile acids are small molecules made by the liver that help the absorption of fat and cholesterol in the GI tract while also serving as a protective barrier against invading pathogens.  Because C. difficile spores use the ratios of bile acids as cues for germination, the actively growing bacteria must have adapted means to avoid their toxic properties.

Dana,Gaddy,Professor,"My laboratory has been engaged in multiple areas of NIH-funded musculoskeletal research since 1996. We were the first to identify the non-steroidal gonadal inhibin hormones in regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal-skeletal axis in mice, and the role of changes in inhibins that signal the onset of menopause (reproductive aging) to the onset of increasing bone turnover. We also demonstrated the anabolic effect of continual Inhibin exposure in normal mice and in bone repair.  Our cellular focus on Inhibins and the related factor, Activin A revealed that Activin A suppresses local bone resorption through suppression of osteoclast formation, motility and survival. Our ongoing work is in the area of specific inhibin/betaglycan receptor interactions that mediate the effects on bone cells. We are also greatly interested in improving the low bone mass that we were the first to identify in both humans with Down Syndrome (DS) and in mouse models of DS as a low bone turnover disease. Our current NIH-funded research is working to identify the mechanisms of reduced fracture healing and compromised bone regeneration in Down Syndrome. We have demonstrated the efficacy of both PTH and SclAb in DS, and are now actively testing nutriceuticals to increase bone mass in mouse models of Down Syndrome. The limitations of using mouse models to study bone disease led us to our most recent and exciting endeavors in collaboration with TAMU experts in reproduction and embryo transfer technologies to develop a large platform model of bone disease, using sheep. We have generated the first large animal model of hypophosphatasia (HPP) via high efficiency gene editing of a knock-in point mutation in the ALPL gene, whose musculoskeletal and dental phenotypes are consistent with human HPP. We are now using this model to determine the etiology of mineralization deficiencies, muscle weakness and premature tooth loss by analysis of longitudinal biopsies and analysis of muscle, bone and dental specimens using CT, microCT, mechanical testing, immunohistochemistry, histomorphometry and ex vivo bone marrow cultures.",Professor||Adjunct Professor,Veterinary Integrative Biosciences||Veterinary Physiology and Pharmacology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n2dc10a1a

A funded research area in severe accident analysis has come about that allows me to return to my PhD research.  <br /><br />I believe that developing a strong, externally funded program is an area to be emphasized, particularly because I have interests in experimental research.  To this end, I have maintained a continuously funded laboratory with major investments into equipment that allow me to acquire unique, more challenging data than that from many other heat transfer laboratories.  In particular, my 157-kW steam generator system allows me to perform steam-water experiments at elevated pressure for two-phase (gas-liquid) phenomena occurring in nuclear reactors, whereas much of the published data is for air-water systems at atmospheric pressure.  I maintain several large-scale (for a university lab) ASME-certified pressure 2.vessels and state-of-the-art instrumentation and data acquisition systems, along with project-specific test sections.<br /><br />My three main lines of research at TAMU, with their trajectories and impacts are summarized below:<br /><br />1.

Pingwei,Li,Professor,"The research in my lab focuses on elucidating the structural basis of innate immune responses towards microbial nucleic acids. The cGAS/STING pathway plays a central role in innate immunity toward bacterial and viral DNA. cGAS is activated by dsDNA and catalyzes the synthesis of a cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP, which binds to the adaptor STING that mediates the recruitment and activation of protein kinase TBK1 and transcription factor IRF-3. Activated IRF-3 translocates to the nucleus and induces the expression of type I interferons (IFN), an important family of antiviral cytokine. To elucidate the mechanism of cGAS activation, we determined the structures of cGAS in isolation and in complex with DNA. The cGAS/DNA complex structure reveals that cGAS interacts with DNA through two binding sites. Enzyme assays and IFN-? reporter assays of cGAS mutants demonstrate that interactions at both DNA binding sites are essential for cGAS activation. To investigate how cGAMP activates STING, we determined the structures of STING in isolation and in complex with cGAMP. These structures reveal that STING forms a V-shaped dimer and binds cGAMP at the dimer interface. We have also determined the structures of TBK1 in complex with two inhibitors, which show that TBK1 exhibits an I?B kinase fold with distinct domain arrangement. To elucidate the mechanism of IRF-3 recruitment by STING, we determined the structure of a phosphorylated STING peptide bound to IRF-3. To understand how phosphorylation activates IRF-3, we solved the structure of an IRF-3 phosphomimetic mutant bound to CBP, which reveals how phosphorylation induces the dimerization and activation of IRF-3.",Professor,Biochemistry and Biophysics,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n31ebad17

During her PhD studies, using genetics and screen she discovered LidA, a Legionella pneumophila effector exported into macrophages through bacterial Icm/Dot Type IV secretion system. As a research scientist, she lead an interdisciplinary team to develop a live-cell multi day microfluidics platform to study the temporal response to stress of persistent Mycobacteria. Currently, she is interested in the vertical integration of the basic science medical curriculum and interprofessional research practices into medical curriculum to advance the next generation of medical treatments.",Instructional Assistant Professor||Director,Health Science Center||Health Science Center,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n3706f4f0

Mark,Fossett,Professor,"My research explores the intersection of social and spatial demography and racial and ethnic inequality and stratification.  Much of my work examines the conceptualization and measurement of intergroup inequality and seeks to understand how it varies across time and across communities.  Relatedly, I have studied how community characteristics like relative minority size affect racial and ethnic prejudice and racial and ethnic socioeconomic inequality.  I also have focused on the question of how imbalances in the number of men and women in communities affects family formation and the fraction of children being reared in mother-father families.  In recent years I have examined the conception and measurement of residential segregation and formulated a new measurement framework.  This new approach makes it possible to unify research on micro-level processes of residential attainment and city-level outcomes for residential segregation.  It also makes it possible to measure segregation free of the vexing problem of index bias.  Finally, understandings rooted in the new framework clarify how to best measure group residential separation noting that the dissimilarity index - the mostly widely used measure - is flawed and unreliable for assessing this aspect of residential segregation.  I also have pioneered using computational models to investigate residential segregation dynamics.  Agent translate discursive theories of segregation into concrete representations that then can be used to explore the implications of theory via judicious model-based experimentation.  Most segregation research involves analysis of observational data at the aggregate level. This is poorly suited for untangling the complex effects that produce patterns of racial and ethnic segregation in urban areas. I have shown how computational models provide a potentially useful option for investigating how complex micro-level dynamics produce group differences in residential distributions across urban areas.",Professor,Sociology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n3ba5e68e

Beiyan,Nan,Assistant Professor,"I am interested in understanding the mechanisms of fundamental biological processes in bacteria. My lab uses soil bacterium Myxococcus xanthus as the model organism. Several aspects of M. xanthus make it an ideal model for understanding bacterial physiology. First, M. xanthus cells utilize sophisticated systems to move on solid surfaces, which involve cytoplasmic and periplasmic proteins, filamentous cytoskeletons, membrane channels, cell wall, and cell surface components. Second, cells constantly communicate with each other and with their environment. Cells usually move in coordinated groups but also as isolated ""adventurous"" individuals, which allows this bacterium to feed on soil detritus and prey on other microorganisms. Third, when the availability of nutrients or prey decrease in the environment, most cells exhibit behaviors that include aggregation into fruiting bodies and conversion of individual cells into spores.<br /><br /><br /><br />I have been using the super resolution photo-activated localization microscopy (PALM) to track single molecule dynamics of proteins in live bacterial cells. With this technique, I have achieved 10 millisecond time resolution (100 frames per second) and 80 nm spatial resolution. These studies were initiated because the most widely used fluorescence microscopy techniques (including confocal, deconvolution, etc.) can only provide resolution to about 200 nm due to the diffraction of light, which is often insufficient for many studies because of the small size of bacterial cells (usually a few hundred nanometers in diameter).<br /><br /><br /><br />Our research topics cover motility, development (fruiting body formation and biofilm formation), cytoskeleton, and cell wall assembly.",Assistant Professor,Biology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n3fe4c57e

Thomas,Meek,Professor,"Marketed drugs have been developed for representatives of all six classes of enzymes, and comprise essential therapies for the treatment of cancers, HIV/AIDS, hypercholesterolemia, and bacterial infections. The availability of known point mutations that are causative of human cancers , as well as the full genomic descriptions of many pathogens, such as parasitic protozoa and infectious bacteria, provides an emerging means to identify new or known enzymes that would constitute potential drug targets. Likewise, the availability of crystal structures of many of these enzymes or their analogues, provides a means to rationally design new inhibitors of enzyme drug targets via the use of molecular modelling and a full understanding of the chemical mechanism of the target enzymes, as an important adjuvant to inhibitor discovery via high-throughput screening.<br /><br /><br /><br />Our laboratory will initially focus on the detailed study of the mechanisms of cysteine proteases such as cathepsin C, the isocitrate lyase of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and human ATP-citrate lyase, by the use of pre-steady-state and steady-state kinetics, as well as by use of existing crystal structures of these enzymes, to inform the design of both covalent and other mechanism-based modes for the inactivation of these enzymes.  We will design and synthesize candidate inhibitors, and test them against these and other enzyme targets, and determine their suitability as potential drug candidates.",Professor,Biochemistry and Biophysics,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n41081941

The failure to completely replicate the genome during S phase or partially re-replicate chromosomes leads to genome instability- a hallmark of cancer cells. The central questions investigated in the laboratory are concerned with how replication initiation sites are established in chromosomes and how they are regulated during conventional (G1/S/G2/M) and alternative cell cycles, including endoreplication (gap-S-gap-S...) and locus-specific gene amplification. The current focus of the lab is to use high throughput (nascent strand) DNA sequencing to generate a comprehensive map of replication initiation sites under different physiological conditions.",Professor and Chair||Professor,Cell Biology and Genetics||Biochemistry and Biophysics,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n4128afa1

Parasitology provides a rich subject area for studies of ecology and evolutionary biology.  Numerous topics such as ecosystem dynamics, mating systems, or coevolution can be addressed because parasites are extremely diverse.  By diversity, I include not only the myriad of taxa that have independently evolved a parasitic lifestyle, but also the diversity in life cycles, modes of reproduction, host species, and ecosystems utilized by parasites.  This diversity also allows for comparative studies to address theories or unifying principles that span ecosystems or taxonomic groups.  Furthermore, there are many practical applications such as studying the evolution of drug resistance, or using parasite community structure to assess ""ecosystem health"".

Travis,Hein,Professor,"My laboratory studies the regulation of microvascular function at the level of arterioles in the retinal and coronary circulations. Sufficient blood flow supply of oxygen and nutrients to tissues to maintain normal function is controlled in large part by changes in the diameter of arterioles. Vasoconstriction or vasodilation of these small arteries will decrease or increase blood flow and nutrient delivery to the tissue, respectively. Two key chemical factors that are produced within the endothelial cells of blood vessels to control their diameter are nitric oxide (NO), a vasodilator, and endothelin-1, a vasoconstrictor. An imbalance in the production and/or release of these vasoactive factors has been implicated in the early stages of several cardiovascular diseases, but the underlying mechanisms contributing to these pathophysiological changes remain unclear. To address this knowledge gap, our research focuses on identifying cellular and molecular mechanisms that contribute to the vasomotor responses of arterioles to NO and endothelin-1 under conditions of health and disease. Current approaches that we use to investigate these mechanisms in the microcirculation include isolated and perfused arterioles, cultured vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, biochemical and molecular techniques (for detection of NO, superoxide anion, protein, and mRNA in arterioles), pharmacological and silencing RNA (siRNA) treatments, and blood flow velocity assessment via Doppler ultrasound.",Professor,Medical Physiology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n45051e1b

Sakhila,Banu,Professor,"My long-term goals are two-fold: 1) to understand the molecular mechanism of prenatal CrVI exposure on placental and fetal development, ovarian and uterine function, and pregnancy outcome, and; 2) to understand the protective effects of various natural and synthetic antioxidants (such as edaravone, glutathione, vitamin C and resveratrol) against the deleterious effects of heavy-metals, CrVI in particular.  Current research in my lab is focused on the study of reproductive and developmental toxicity of CrVI. Drinking water contamination with CrVI in the United States is a growing problem due to increased usage of CrVI and improper disposal of Cr waste into the environment. Significant contamination with CrVI has been found in the drinking water sources of all the states in the U.S. Effects of Cr on reproductive health in women and development in children have received less attention. Epidemiological data document that women exposed to Cr in environmental or occupational settings suffer from infertility, gynecological problems, congenital malformation of fetuses, neonatal mortality, and premature abortions with increased levels of Cr in their blood, urine and placenta. Cr can bind directly to DNA and nuclear proteins, cause DNA strand breaks and mutations, alter the balance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants, and activate several cell signaling pathways. Therefore, my current research objective is to determine molecular pathways and identify target genes/proteins by which Cr alters prenatal development and organogenesis of female reproductive system in the offspring.",Professor,Veterinary Integrative Biosciences,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n4783d1f1

Studies are in progress to 1) determine the role of sumoylation in the viral life cycle, 2) evaluate the effect of sumoylation on the structure and activity of the E1 helicase, 3) understand the mechanism by which sumoylation influences E2 stability and transcriptional activity, and 4) determine how sumoylation is modulated by the viral E6 oncoprotein.  In addition to the role of sumoylation in the viral life cycle, we are also exploring how sumoylation participates in normal keratinocyte differentiation.

Mary,Wicksten,Professor,"I am studying the Thoridae, a family of small-sized marine shrimp that are remarkably diverse in the cold waters of the North Pacific. Evidence suggests that these shrimp may be losing range due to global warming. They may be replaced by members of a different family, the Palaemonidae, a group of more aggressive predatory shrimp. But to study such a replacement, one must identify the shrimp. The last major study was in 1906. All previous work has been morphological. Evidence from my own work and that of Greg Jensen, University of Washington, suggests that not only have species been confused (one species is actually two, three species actually are only one) but the generic designation may depend on temperature-dependent features. With a small start-up grant from the Arctic Biodiversity Study, I am collaborating with Luis Hurtado,, Department of Wildlife and Fisheries Science, to obtain some molecular data on genetic affinities within the Thoridae and potentially allied shrimp taxa. These data may at least indicate which of the supposed genera are distinct or even if the Thoridae is indeed a natural group.

In pursuit of this goal, she has investigated how individuals use language to form collective identities with and against others, how leaders use narratives to mobilize those collectivities for action, and how processes of dialogue and deliberation can build bridges between oppositional stakeholders to facilitate the achievement of deeper shared understandings and more democratic public decisions. Her work has been published in journals such as Journal of Communication, Management Communication Quarterly, and Journal of Applied Communication Research. Her co-authored book, Sex and Stigma: Stories of Everyday Life in Nevada's Legal Brothels received the 2019 Book of the Year Award from the Critical Cultural Studies Division of the National Communication Association; Outstanding Book Award from the Organization for the Study of Communication, Language, and Gender; and Honorable Mention for the Sarah A.

In parallel, I am investigating the role of adipose tissue inflammation in the development of metabolic disease after menopause.

Luis,Garcia,Professor,"I am interested in understanding how behavioral states are regulated at the molecular and genetic level. My lab addresses this complex question in the well-studied nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Several physical aspects of this worm make it convenient for integrating whole organism system biology studies with genetic/molecular analysis of neurobiology and behavior. C. elegans is an anatomically simple organism; it is 1mm in size, and it contains ~ 1000 somatic cells, a third of which are neurons. The worm is also transparent, and thus every cell can be visualized by light microscopy. Behavioral mutants can be efficiently generated through standard chemical mutagenesis. In addition, gene functions involved in motivational and behavioral regulation can be determined by transgenic techniques.<br /><br /><br /><br />My lab investigates the interplay between feeding and sex-specific mating behavior to understand how chemo/mechano-sensory and motor outputs are controlled under various physiological conditions. We study male mating by using genetics to de-construct this behavior into its fundamental sensory-motor components. We then use a combination of transgenics, pharmacology, classical genetics and laser microsurgery to understand how individual motor sub-behaviors are coordinated to produce gross behaviors during periods when the animal is food deprived, and when it is food satiated.",Professor,Biology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n4cd2f794

I often work at the nexus of typically disparate fields of study, for example combining genetic, phylogenetic, physiological and macroecological perspectives in a single analysis of distribution and dispersal (Bernardo et al. 2007).

One of the targets of his vaccine research is  brucellosis, a bacterial zoonotic disease caused by certain members of the genus Brucella.  Brucellosis is a great concern to public health in developing countries due to widespread prevalence of Brucella infections in livestock.  In the US, reservoirs of Brucella infections in wildlife, such as bison, elk, and feral swine, continue to pose a threat to livestock industries and human health.  The currently available brucellosis veterinary vaccines are neither efficacious in wild animals nor safe for human use.  Dr. Vemulapalli has developed novel recombinant vaccine strains that showed dramatically enhanced vaccine efficacy against brucellosis in murine models.  Testing these vaccines in domestic and wild animals is a goal of his research program.  Research projects in his laboratory are aimed at 1) understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of Brucella species, 2) developing attenuated Brucella strains as vectors to deliver protective proteins of other pathogens and tumors, 3) developing recombinant subunit vaccines to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, and 4) development of molecular diagnostics assays for infectious disease investigations.",Executive Associate Dean,School of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n5889f585

Christine,Merlin,Associate Professor,"Our research broadly lies in understanding how organisms respond and adapt to changing environments, with an emphasis on circadian biology. Organisms from bacteria to humans use circadian clocks to control a plethora of biochemical, physiological and behavioral rhythms. These clocks are synchronized to daily and seasonal environmental changes to allow organisms to tune specific activities at the appropriate times of day or year.<br /><br />In our laboratory, we use the eastern North American migratory monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) as a model system to study animal clock mechanisms and the role of circadian clocks and clock genes in a fascinating biological output, the animal long-distance migration. Every fall, like clockwork, millions of monarch butterflies start migrating thousands of miles from North America to reach their overwintering sites in central Mexico. During their journey south, migrating monarchs use a time-compensated sun compass orientation mechanism to maintain a constant flight bearing. Circadian clocks located in the antennae provide the critical internal timing device for compensation of the sun movement across the sky over the course of the day. The recent sequencing of the monarch genome and the establishment of genetic tools to knockout clock genes (and others) in vivo using nuclease-mediated gene targeting approaches provides us with a unique opportunity to uncover the molecular and cellular underpinnings of the butterfly clockwork, its migratory behavior and their interplay.",Assistant Professor,Biology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n5a23a5d7

A variety of trace gases including halocarbons (e.g. methyl halides, trihalomethanes), nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, and methane are both produced and degraded in the ocean.  The distribution and strength of the various oceanic sources and sinks impacts the exchange of these gases between the ocean and atmosphere.  Through ship-board measurements, laboratory studies and modeling, my research group examines the role/magnitude of oceanic influence on trace gases that are important in the atmosphere as stratospheric ozone depletors or greenhouse gases.<br /><br />We also study the impact of organic matter remineralization on dissolved inorganic carbon and pH.  This relates to my trace gas research in that the oxidation of organic matter increases CO2, and to characterize the dissolved CO2 also requires understanding the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC).  In addition to measuring CO2 in the air and seawater, we also measure the DIC and total alkalinity (TA).  This has allowed my research group to begin characterizing the DIC/pH system in the deep Gulf of Mexico.

Narendra,Kumar,Associate Professor,"1.   Obesity associated metabolic syndrome (MetS) is both a US and a worldwide epidemic and a major burden to healthcare system. Chronic low-grade inflammation (CLGI) is a well-established characteristic of the obese-human condition and though, the gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa is the first tissue that interacts with dietary components and luminal microbiota both of which are known to regulate obesity, the research on the role of GI-mucosa in obesity associated MetS is lacking. Findings from my lab support a key role of Janus kinase 3 (Jak3), a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, in intestinal and systemic CLGI associated obesity and diabetes in both an animal-model and in humans. Our publications, and unpublished data indicate that Jak3 regulates; colonic and systemic CLGI, and multiple symptoms of metabolic syndrome. Our goal is to determine the associated underlying mechanisms. Our current focus is on tissue-specific roles of Jak3 and associated signaling complexes in CLGI-onset as a precursor for;  (a) obesity and diabetes,  (b) Obesity and Alzheimer's disease, and  (c) inflammatory bowel disease.<br /><br /> 2.   Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that includes Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory condition of gastrointestinal tract. Annual death from these diseases are over 70,000.00, and the incidences of new cases have been rising over the years.  Because the repairs of intestinal mucosa (Restitution) are compromised during IBD, the research focus of our lab is to dissect the roles of intestinal epithelial, intestinal immune cells and gut microbiota in mucosal restitution. Our lab was pioneered the functions of Jak3 in intestinal epithelial mucosa. We show that IL-2 (a cytokine produced during intestinal inflammation) promotes mucosal wound repair through Jak3 complexed with villin, ShcA, and ?-catenin. Studies are underway to define the tissue-specific Jak3-mediated signaling pathways that regulate CLGI as a precursor for the onset of IBD.",Associate Professor and Director of Graduate Studies||Associate Professor,Pharmaceutical Sciences||Pharmaceutical Sciences,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n5bcfc45e

Michael,Smotherman,Professor,"Evolution and Neurobiology of Communication<br /><br />Communication is an essential part of sociality, and an animal's vocal communications provide a window into their cognitive capabilities, motivations, and behavioral ecology.  Communication is also a important model of sensorimotor neurobiology because vocalizations are the motor output of a sophisticated suite of brain pathways that integrate across multiple sensory modalities and time scales. Vocal communication systems are highly diverse because they have been shaped by intense natural and sexual selection. Studying the evolution of communication networks in the brain provides important insight into how environment and ecology molded the social brain.<br /><br /><br /><br />Our lab studies bats because of their biosonar capabilities and their unusually broad repertoire of communication calls and songs.<br /><br />Echolocation provides an exciting model system for exploring how multiple brain pathways interact to control behavior on a millisecond time scale.

Our behavioral studies of bats echolocating in groups has shed light on how they coordinate their sonar systems to minimize interference with one another.  This research has direct relevance to man-made sonar and wireless communications systems.<br /><br />Singing by bats offers exiting new opportunities to young investigators to explore how mammals and birds converged upon a similar behavior via different neural mechanisms.

Thomas,Mcknight,Professor and Head,"My lab is currently investigating mechanisms that regulate telomerase activity in plants. We previously showed that the pattern of telomerase expression in plants is remarkably similar to the pattern seen in humans, despite fundamental differences in development between plants and animals. Telomerase is abundantly expressed in reproductive organs but is undetectable in most vegetative organs (Fitzgerald et al., 1996). Additionally, telomerase can be induced in leaves and other vegetative organs by exposure to exogenous auxin.<br /><br /><br /><br />To isolate genes that regulate telomerase, we screened a large population of activation tagged lines of Arabidopsis thaliana, and found that several lines that ectopically express telomerase in leaves. The first line we characterized over-expressed a gene encoding a small zinc finger transcription factor we designated TELOMERASE ACTIVATOR 1 (Ren et al., 2004). This factor does not bind to the promoter for TERT, which encodes the catalytically active subunit of telomerase. Instead, it binds to and activates transcription of BT2, a gene encoding a component of a ubiquitin ligase (Ren et al., 2007). Our working model is that the BT2 ubiquitin ligase marks a telomerase repressor for destruction, thereby allowing expression of telomerase. Efforts in the lab are currently focused on identifying the presumed telomerase repressor protein and other proteins that interact with BT2.",Professor and Head,Biology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n5c3b294a

Darryl,de Ruiter,Professor,"I am a paleoanthropologist whose research focuses on the ecology and evolution of the early hominins of Africa. My research centers on the origin of the genus Homo, and on early representatives of that genus. In 2010, my research team and I announced the discovery of a new hominin species - Australopithecus sediba - from the site of Malapa in South Africa. Australopithecus sediba represents a curious mixture of both australopith-like and Homo-like morphologies, and based on this mosaic of characters, we hypothesized that it represents the australopith ancestor of the genus Homo. In 2015 my research team and I announced the discovery of another new hominin species - Homo naledi - from the site of Rising Star, also in South Africa. This species is especially fascinating in that it was likely contemporaneous with the earliest representatives of Homo sapiens, and, perhaps even more remarkable, that they appear to have deliberately disposed of their dead. I am also involved in a series of studies investigating the isotope ecology of modern South Africa in order to better contextualize the isotope ecology of the extinct hominins of South Africa. <br /><br /><br /><br />I originally arrived at Texas A&M University in 2003, after receiving my PhD in Anatomical Sciences at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg in 2001.

To study protein posttranslational modifications, we have constructed methods for the site-specific installation of lysine acetylation and methylation in proteins and will apply them to study functional roles of these two modifications on p53, a tumor suppressor protein. We have also developed a strategy to site-specifically install two noncanonical amino acids into one protein in E. coli and are applying this approach to construct biosensors for small organic molecules and metal ions. Phage display is an efficient method to identify peptides for therapeutic interventions. However, a phage display peptide library has limited structure motifs and functional groups because only 20 natural amino acids can be used to generate a library. We plan to expand the chemical diversity of a phage display library by incorporating multiple noncanonical amino acids and chemically modifying them to extend functional diversities. Screening this unnatural phage display library against therapeutic targets such as c-Abl tyrosine kinase is expected to identify highly potent inhibitors.",Professor,Chemistry,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n5d9506ea

Kathryn,Ryan,Instructional Associate Professor,"1. Delineate the function of the Ran cycle in NPC assembly<br /><br />Model for NPC AssemblyRan is a small GTPase that cycles between a GTP and GDP bound form to regulate many nuclear processes. All 4 components of the Ran cycle were isolated in the npa screen. Characterization of these mutants revealed membrane defects and the accumulation of nucleoporin containing vesicles in the cytoplasm. The accumulation of such vesicles in these npa mutants suggests that NPC assembly involves a Ran-mediated vesicular fusion event at the outer nuclear envelope. In this model of NPC assembly, a subset of nucleoporins is first concentrated in vesicles (A). When the vesicles fuse with the outer nuclear membrane in a Ran-dependent manner (B), a critical, localized concentration of these nucleoporins triggers pore formation (C) and nucleates new NPC assembly (D and E). To test the model, work is being done to characterize these vesicles. This includes biochemical approaches to purify vesicles and cell biological and genetic approaches to determine how vesicle-associated proteins contribute to NPC assembly. In addition, we are working to understand how Ran interacts with these vesicles to mediate vesicle fusion to the outer nuclear membrane.<br /><br /><br /><br />2. Define additional steps in the NPC assembly pathway<br /><br />There are events both upstream and downstream of the Ran cycle in the assembly pathway. Further cloning and characterization of mutants from the npa collection will continue to identify factors involved in other steps of NPC biogenesis and provide a platform from which to study these discrete events.",Instructional Associate Professor,Biology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n613870d1

Long-term interests in the lab are centered on understanding how B. burgdorferi promotes its pathogenic potential and persists in the disparate hosts it occupies in nature (e.g., both ticks and mammals).  In this regard, the research program is aligned with: (i) regulatory pathways that contribute to the establishment of infection during the arthropod to mammalian transition; (ii) identifying and characterizing surface structures that contribute to the colonization and maintenance of infection via adherence mechanisms; and (iii) the ability of B. burgdorferi and relapsing fever Borrelia to persistently infect hosts in the face of a potent innate and adaptive immune response.",Professor and Associate Head,Microbial Pathogenesis and Immunology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n638ae603
Gary,Kunkel,Associate Professor,"An important step to control the amount of RNA or protein in particular types of cells is at the level of transcription of genes. Our lab studies a multifunctional vertebrate transcriptional activator protein known as SBF/Staf/ZNF143. This protein binds to SPH sites within promoters of many genes that produce small stable RNAs (e.g., snRNAs and others) PLUS probably over 2000 promoters of genes that produce mRNAs. Two separate activation domains in this protein direct its action at small RNA vs. mRNA gene promoters. We are using zebrafish as a vertebrate model organism to study the roles of SBF/Staf during development. In vivo studies are coupled with biochemical and molecular biology methods to decipher the mechanisms by which this protein stimulates transcription of various types of genes.",Associate Professor,Biochemistry and Biophysics,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n638b96b2

Abraham,Clearfield,Distinguished Professor,"Our research interests are focused in solid state and materials chemistry and encompass a wide variety of projects. An important goal is the ability to design and synthesize new materials whose structure and properties can be predicted and controlled. Layered compounds are amenable to manipulation to produce new structures because of the weak forces between layers. We have learned how to separate the layers of several classes of compounds and are reconstituting them into novel materials. For example, we have prepared staged materials in which alternating layers are hydrophobic and hydrophilic.<br /><br /><br /><br />The surfaces of our layered materials react with a variety of molecules to bond them to the surface. We are developing such materials for drug delivery, heterogeneous catalysis, and polymer-nanoparticle composites.<br /><br /><br /><br />Single crystal X-ray diffraction has been the key tool in elucidating the structure of solids. For many compounds, single crystals are unavailable so that indirect methods need to be used. We pioneered the solution of crystal structures from X-ray powder data and have had considerable success.

Marcetta,Darensbourg,Distinguished Professor,"Bio-inspired Catalysts for Hydrogen Production: The ultimate, home-run, goal of our work is to synthesize and develop a robust, highly active hydrogen-producing catalyst comprised of earth-abundant transition metals within a ligand environment that is inspired by the biological Figure 3hydrogenase (H2ase) enzyme active sites. Progress in precise structural modeling of the illusive ""rotated"" structure displayed in the as-isolated, mixed-valent FeIIFe state in the past decade has permitted in depth analysis of electronic structure by Mo ssbauer, EPR (ENDOR), and computational chemistry.  New electrocatalysts for hydrogen production: The connection between the Fe(NO)2 unit and the Fe(CX)3 (X = O or N) unit found in hydrogenase enzyme active sites offers opportunity for design of new catalysts, one of which is shown.

William,Park,Professor,"Most of our work in the last few years has focused on manipulating starch biosynthesis in plants. This has led to the identification of a number of specific DNA polymorphisms that have a profound impact on the structure and functional properties of starch granules. Interestingly, the effect of some of these polymorphisms is temperature sensitive. For example, a key G/T polymorphism at the 5' leader intron splice site of rice granule bound starch synthase has little phenotypic effect at 18 ?C, but at 25 ?C it activates an alternate splice site that results in a premature open reading frame. At 32 ?C, a third nonconsensus TT/GT splice site is activated. This type of temperature sensitivity is one of the key factors responsible for the complex genotype x environment relationships seen in starch structure and represents a good target for manipulation via biotechnology. We have also worked with an industrial partner and a breeder to develop the first commercial rice varieties specifically tailored to work with a new type of processing technology and to identify the genes responsible for optimal raw material/process interactions.

Margaret,Glasner,Associate Professor,"Evolution is the organizing principle of biology and provides the cornerstone of our approach to understand the relationships between protein structure and function. We combine bioinformatics, biochemistry, and genetics to address fundamental questions about protein evolution, such as: What structural and mechanistic features of enzymes increase their capacity to evolve new functions? How do new metabolic pathways evolve? Are there multiple evolutionary pathways to evolve new enzyme activities?<br /><br /><br /><br />Our primary focus is on how catalytic promiscuity serves as the raw material for evolving new enzyme activities. Catalytic promiscuity is the ability to catalyze different chemical reactions using the same active site. Many enzymes in one branch of the protein family we are studying are catalytically promiscuous, and this activity has been incorporated into new metabolic pathways more than once. Comparing the sequences and structures of these proteins will identify characteristics that permitted them to evolve the second activity.<br /><br /><br /><br />Our goal is to use results from our research to identify fundamental evolutionary principles that can can help decipher protein structure-function relationships, predict protein functions, and improve protein engineering methods.",Associate Professor,Biochemistry and Biophysics,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n721200c3

Luiz,Davidovich,Research Professor,"The theoretical contributions of Luiz Davidovich have led to new areas of research and groundbreaking experiments, of relevance to quantum information and, in particular, to the study of open systems, decoherence and the quantum-classical transition. The theme of decoherence has been frequently present in his work: he made important proposals of experiments on the role of environment in the emergence of the classical world from the quantum substrate. Some of his proposals in the area of cavity quantum electrodynamics, in collaboration with the group of Serge Haroche in Paris, were mentioned in the press release of the 2012 Nobel Prize.    His work  has had impact on laser theory, cavity quantum electrodynamics, quantum information, and quantum metrology. Examples are the theoretical analysis of the two-photon micromaser, confirmed by the experiment held at Ecole Normale Superieure, in Paris, in 1986; the introduction of the concept of quantum random walks; the first experimental proposal of teleportation; the proposal of an experimental demonstration of the dynamics of a ""Schr?dinger cat"" state of the electromagnetic field, also realized experimentally in Paris; developments on the theory of the laser; the work on the dynamics of entanglement under decoherence; and the theory of noisy quantum metrology, the last two developed with his group at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Theoretical results and experiments carried out in Rio de Janeiro, with his group, unveiled the subtle dynamics and the fragility of entangled states under noisy environments, and had a strong impact in the field of quantum information. Quantum sensing has been an important part of his work in the last few years, with theoretical contributions and experiments at the quantum optics lab of his group. An important paper published in Nature Physics by him and his collaborators derived an extension of the theory of quantum metrology to open systems.  The theoretical and experimental work on entanglement has generated publications in Nature, Science, and Physical Review Letters, among other journals. He has also had an active role in the development of science in Brazil and in other developing countries.  He has been Scientific Director of the National Institute for Science and Technology for Quantum Information, a Brazilian network that involves several institutions throughout the country, and contributed to the development and consolidation of this area of research in the country. He received the TWAS Physics Prize in 2001 and the Brazilian National Science Prize in 2010. He is foreign member of the USA National Academy of Sciences, the European Academy of Sciences, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He is Fellow of the American Physical Society and of Optika (former Optical Society of America).",Research Professor,Institute of Quantum Science,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n737815fd

Farida,Sohrabji,University Distinguished Professor and Department Head,"My research interests lie at the intersection of neuroendocrinology, neuroinflammation and aging. For the last 10 years, my work has focused on ischemic stroke, specifically, to understand how the aging brain copes with stroke. In North America, stroke risk increases with age and in this aging demographic, women are more likely to sustain a stroke and more likely to have long term disability, poor quality of life and have more neuropsychiatric problems after stroke such as depression and cognitive impairment. This problem is compounded by the fact that few stroke therapies are available. Most stroke neuroprotectants have not been successfully translated from the bench to bedside. Using preclinical models, we have focused on acute pathological changes at the blood brain barrier and central and peripheral inflammation as well as long-term consequences, such as changes to reward pathways and post-stroke depression and dementia. I am also interested in developing novel stroke therapies for stroke in this population and our studies on epigenetic modifications such as histone methylation and non-coding (mi)RNA due to aging/stroke have provided several candidate molecules. Our recent work focuses on the role of the gut microbiome and gut metabolites on stroke recovery, and its potential for understanding the pathophysiology of stroke. <br /><br />Related to my research goals, I am actively interested in promoting the inclusion of sex as a biological variable and attention to sex differences in medicine. Through medical and graduate coursework, research seminars and community talks, I am a vocal advocate for recognizing sex and gender differences in disease processes and drug therapies. I founded the Women's Health in Neuroscience program at Texas A&M University College of Medicine to create a community of researchers and foster collaboration on gender medicine and women's health, and to train new scholars in this area.",University Distinguished Professor and Department Headd,Neuroscience and Experimental Therapeutics,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n772c9962

Jay,Rooker,Professor,"My research centers on the community and population ecology of aquatic organisms, with a special emphasis on marine fishes. I am particularly interested in linkages between habitat selection, individual responses, and survival. My work is both laboratory and field-based, and I typically use both quantitative and experimental approaches to elucidate the importance of biotic and abiotic factors that influence growth, condition, and survival. In addition, we are currently using a variety of natural markers to solve ecological problems. Otolith chemistry is being used to retrospectively determine the environmental histories of marine fishes. The premise of otolith chemistry is that certain elements or isotopes are incorporated into otoliths in proportion to their concentrations in the environment, and thus we use these elemental fingerprints to distinguish individuals from different environments or regions. We also use dietary tracers (stable isotopes, fatty acids) to investigate marine food web structure since consumer tissues reflect the isotopic and fatty acid composition of prey in a predictable manor. These natural biomarkers provide time-integrated or long-term measures of diet, and both approaches afford information on source(s) of organic matter supporting local food webs as well as trophic relationships of associated consumers.

Raul,Medina,Professor,Dr. Medina's research centers around the role that ecological factors play in the population genetics of arthropods. He is particularly interested in the incorporation of evolutionary ecology considerations into pest control practices. His laboratory is currently assessing how species interactions at macroscopic (host-parasite interactions) and microscopic (arthropod microbiomes) levels interact with genetic variation of agricultural pests and arthropod vectors of human disease. His research team is exploring if the same principles governing insect herbivores' adaptation to their hosts translate into arthropod parasites of animals. He is also interested in understanding the factors that make some biotechnology innovations in agriculture controversial in the public sphere.,Professor,Entomology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n807b8d90

Sanjay,Antony Babu,Assistant Professor,"Plants are in constant interactions with a large diversity of microorganisms, that belong to various biological kingdoms including archaea, bacteria, fungi and protista. In nature, these inter-kingdom interactions can be both cooperative and detrimental to the host-plants. My major research focus is to understand the dynamics of inter-kingdom microbiome-interactions and how it affects the crop production. We use cutting-edge culture-independent (metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and metabolomics) and culture-dependent (culturomics) methods combined with computational biology. We especially employ a systematics-based approach, so that we can identify individual organisms involved in these interactions, their biological functions, impacts on neighboring niches, and metabolic activity.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Current research projects<br /><br /><br /><br />The research has several direct biotechnological applications, and the research in our lab focuses on the following:<br /><br /><br /><br />1. Develop bioferlitizers/biopesticides: By disentangling the microbial functions that are essential for different growth stages of crop plants, we intend to develop ""soil probiotics"" to improve crop health. In order to achieve this, we study natural ecosystems and wild plants related to crops. The technology developed will be sustainable and environmentally friendly. Our current research focuses on developing microbial inoculum assemblages from teosinte (ancestor of modern maize) and transferring the microbiota to maize to improve pest and pathogen resistance.<br /><br /> <br /><br /><br /><br />2. Pathobiomes of plants: The concept of pathobiome is an emerging field in pathogen biology. In recent times, it has been noted that pathogens do not act alone in natural ecosystems, but along with a mob of other microorganisms. Deciphering the interaction between a plant pathogen and its associated microbiomes is necessary to understand pathogensis and also to design control measures. Research in my lab specifically focusses on mycosphere bacterial microbiota of pathogenic fungi. Our recent research focusses on pathobiomes associated with Fusarium wilt of cotton.<br /><br /> <br /><br /><br /><br />3. Indicators of microbial dysbiosis: Dysbiosis is a microbial imbalance caused by perturbation in an ecosystem or a niche. Plant microbiomes experience dysbiosis during biotic (disease) and abiotic (drought, flooding, heat etc) stress. We study dysbiosis to understand shift in microbial processes, detect stress indicators and design stress alleviation measures including developing microbial inoculum (biofertilizers).",Assistant Professor,Plant Pathology and Microbiology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n809679df

A number of cellular proteins that are important for viral transcription have been identified, and we would like to define the precise roles of these proteins in establishing correct levels of viral gene expression. We are also exploring some specific questions related to the general mechanism of transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II and the biochemical details of transcriptional regulation. In particular, we are developing assays to directly assess effects of transcriptional regulatory proteins on discrete steps in the initiation process, including transcription complex assembly, separation of the two strands of template DNA at the initiation site, and promoter clearance by the polymerase as it begins RNA synthesis.",Professor and Associate Department Head,Biochemistry and Biophysics,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n8186cf95

In particular, he is interested in applying both epidemiological and ecological approaches to quantify the emergence, propagation, dissemination, and persistence of resistant enteric bacterial strains in integrated populations of animals, their food products, and humans. Using this knowledge, he hopes to identify opportunities to prevent and intervene against resistance among enteric pathogens in animal agriculture; preferably, by developing readily adoptable and cost-effective management practices suited to modern animal and food production systems.",Professor,Veterinary Pathobiology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n8499539d

His first book, Democracy and Rhetoric: John Dewey on the Arts of Becoming, uses Dewey's philosophy to construct a view of rhetoric, logic, and aesthetics that is consistent with an ethics of democracy that promotes creative individuality. His second book, Rhetoric and Power: The Drama of Classical Greece, explores through the texts of canonical authors like Aeschylus, Gorgias, Thucydides, and Plato how rhetoric was conceptualized as a means of constituting and transforming power in Greek political culture. His third book, The Keys of Power: The Rhetoric and Politics of Transcendentalism, interprets the writing and thought of figures like Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, and Margaret Fuller as active rhetorical engagements with the political controversies of their time. His fourth book, Dewey for a New Age of Fascism: Teaching Democratic Habits, I use Dewey's late writing to offer a critique of fascist anti-humanism and to contrast it with his ideal of democratic humanism and the arts of rhetoric, logic, and aesthetics that provide their foundation.",Professor,Department of Communication & Journalism,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n8a3cbb63

Sumana,Datta,Assistant Provost,"We are currently investigating how organismal level cues regulate the onset of stem cell division during development. Our primary system is the neuroblasts in the brain of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. The trol gene of Drosophila encodes the fly homolog of the mammalian heparan sulfate glycoprotein, Perlecan. Perlecan is found in mice, humans, and C. elegans, and is widely known as a co-receptor for the growth factor FGF. We have shown that Trol, the Drosophila Perlecan homolog, is required for signaling by FGF. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that Trol is also a likely candidate for the Hedgehog co-receptor. Hedgehogs are peptide growth factors which are conserved in mammals and require heparan sulfate glycoproteins for their movement and long-range signaling; however, until now the identity of the protein core was unknown. Our studies demonstrate genetic interactions between trol and hedgehog or patched mutations (patched is the Hedgehog receptor). Further studies reveal that both FGF and Hedgehog signaling activate stem cell division. Current projects involve determining how Trol stimulates FGF and Hedgehog signaling through genetic, molecular, and biochemical analyses.",Assistant Provost,Biochemistry and Biophysics,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n8ce436a7

Our research utilizes a variety of unique in vivo and in vitro models, including transgenic and humanized mice. An underlying theme of our research is the discovery of bio-physiological determinants of disparities in breast cancer incidence and outcome. Another project focuses on the interdependent regulation of ER and p53, and the role of racially disproportionate p53 polymorphisms in mediating breast cancer development and progression. A new project in the laboratory project is focused on investigating the impact of exposure to metabolic syndrome during different stages of development on metabolic function and mammary cancer risk. This line of research was initiated, in part, due to the obesity epidemic in the US, and the increasing prevalence of obesity in younger children. Initial results show that manipulation of gestational, lactational and post-weaning diet can have very significant effects on susceptibility to mammary carcinogenesis.",Professor||Professor,Cell Biology and Genetics||Institute of Biosciences and Technology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n948adb5d

Coran,Watanabe,Associate Professor,"Our research group is actively characterizing the biosynthetic genes of this pathway, which involves a variety of techniques and strategies including: cloning and overexpression of genes, disruption/knockout of genes, enzymology, as well as chemical synthesis/isotopic labeling studies. Functional characterization of the genes of the pathway will not only shed light on the mechanism of azabicycle formation but will also pave the way for genetic engineering of the pathway and the development of new therapeutic methodologies.<br /><br /><br /><br />We have also been investigating the biosynthesis and cellular effects of cycloterpenals and their derivatives. Cycloretinal (all-trans retinal dimer), a representative member of this family of natural products is attributed to causing age-related macular degeneration (AMD). AMD is the leading cause of blindness in adults over the age of 50 that can lead to the loss of central vision. One of the most common early characteristic features of AMD (the dry form) is the accumulation of yellow deposits in the eye called drusen. A more severe form of the disease, the wet form, is characterized by neovascularization (abnormal blood vessel formation).  Our research group aims to study the role of beta-lactoglobulin in cycloretinal synthesis in the eye as an environmental (dietary), non-genetic contributor of AMD.

Especially during his second postdoctoral career in the laboratory of the late Paolo Sassone-Corsi at UCI, he has been tackling the question of how the circadian clock links to metabolic functions. Dr. Sato demonstrated the circadian control of metabolic pathways is reprogramed by aging, which is rescued by caloric restriction (Sato et al., Cell 2017). More recently, Dr. Sato investigated the time-dependent impact of exercise, revealing exercise at the early active phase (fasted phase) exerts robust metabolic responses in skeletal muscle (Sato et al., Cell Metab 2019) and illustrating the atlas of exercise metabolism unique to different exercise timing (Sato et al., Cell under revision). Lastly, Dr. Sato discovered a novel non-canonical role played by the circadian clock specific to pluripotent stem cells (Sato et al., in preparation). Taken together, his past/ongoing studies contribute to the accumulation of evidence underscoring a healthy lifestyle relied on biological clocks.<br /><br /><br /><br />The goals of Sato lab will be to 1) achieve a fundamental understanding of the intertwined link between metabolism, epigenetics, and the circadian clock, and 2) establish translational interventions targeting the circadian clock system to promote human health by using molecular, biochemical, physiological, and bioinformatics approaches.",Assistant Professor,Biology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n9dce7c6b

Michael,Rosynek,Professor and Associate Department Head,"Heterogeneous catalytic processes form the basis for much of the chemical and petroleum processing industries. Solid catalysts enable reactions to occur at sufficiently high rates to be commercially feasible. In many cases, proper selection of a suitable catalyst also permits reaction pathways and product selectivities to occur that would not be kinetically possible in the absence of the catalyst. In our laboratory, we employ kinetic measurements of selected reactions, in combination with a variety of optical and surface spectroscopic and physical characterization techniques, to investigate the surface properties and detailed modes of operation of zeolites, metal oxides and supported metal catalysts.<br /><br /><br /><br />Among the more challenging problems in the field of heterogeneous catalysis is that of selectively oxidizing small alkanes to higher hydrocarbons and oxygenates in high yields. We are currently investigating, for example, the catalyzed oxidative coupling of methane to C2hydrocarbon products. We have established that this reaction occurs via a heterogeneous-homogeneous reaction mechanism, in which the first step is homolytic cleavage of a C-H bond in methane at an O-site on the oxide catalyst surface. The resulting methyl radicals then emanate into the gas phase where they either undergo coupling to the desired C2 products or enter into a series of chain branching homogeneous reactions that lead to the formation of undesired COx products. We are employing x-ray photoelectron, FT-IR and in situ Raman spectroscopies to characterize the nature of the active sites on the catalyst surfaces. Additional studies using isotopic labelling and laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy are providing details about the mechanism of this complex reaction system. Other projects involve studies of the direct selective oxidation of methane to oxygenates, such as formaldehyde and methanol, and to aromatic products.",Professor and Associate Department Head,Chemistry,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n9ed54600

Daniel,Singleton,Professor,"The central focus of the Singleton research group is the study of organic, organometallic, and bioorganic reaction mechanisms, and the key tool that we use in these studies is the determination o kinetic isotope effects (KIEs). In the mid-1990's, we developed a method for the high precision combinatorial determination of small KIEs at natural abundance by NMR. Its direct applicability to complex unlabeled reactants makes this methodology 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than studies requiring labeling. At the same time, it is much more versatile - our technique can look at a great number of reactions that would have been impractical or impossible to study by labeling or mass spectral methods, and the choice of reactants can be readily changed in response to each new experimental result. The simultaneous determination of a complete set of 13C, 2H, and 17O isotope effects possible with our methodology provides a much greater level of information than available from conventional methods. In addition, substantial evidence has accumulated supporting the reliable accuracy of our results.",Professor,Chemistry,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/na0239851

Aref,Arzan Zarin,Assistant Professor,"We are at the beginning of an exciting new era for neuroscience, as our ability to probe neural circuits and their neuronal components is advancing rapidly due to genetic and optogenetic tools. Our research program applies these tools to address fundamental questions about how the same neural circuitry generates different motor patterns, and how such circuits develop and are maintained. We investigate these questions using the Drosophila larva, which has the following advantages:(i) The connectome of the larval motor circuit is near completion, enabling us to identify, at the single-synapse level, the pre and postsynaptic partners of each individual neuron embedded in it. This anatomical map has provided an excellent substrate to study the development, maintenance, and function of larval motor circuits as well as the cell biology of individual neurons embedded within it. (ii) The larval CNS generates multiple motor behaviors that can be studied at the single neuron/single muscle level. Moreover, using the modern optogenetic methods, it is possible to access individual neurons, monitor or alter their activity, and observe the behavioral consequences. (iii) It is also feasible to selectively inactivate or induce ectopic expression of any gene (e.g. those coding for transcription factors) in the neuron of interest, and examine its effect on intrinsic neural properties, morphology, connectivity pattern, and behavioral performance of the animal, thereby linking the gene to development and behavior.",Assistant Professor,Biology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/na0cb5dc6

Joseph,Orr,Associate Professor,"My work aims to understand how internal goals and external environments influence voluntary task selection. The primary goal of my research is to understand the mechanisms underlying cognitive flexibility, the ability to switch between tasks or behaviors quickly and efficiently. Cognitive flexibility is disrupted in several mental health disorders such as psychosis, addiction, and autism. Most studies of cognitive flexibility rely on external cues to determine when and which task to perform, but in the real world this choice is under our voluntary control. While external influences may make these decisions difficult, e.g., seeing ads for junk food when we are trying to make healthy choices, they are nevertheless under a degree of internal control. My work takes the unique perspective of focusing on voluntary control in cognitive flexibility. I take a multimodal approach, using brain imaging (fMRI) and measures of electrical brain activity (EEG) to examine the dynamics of the underlying neural mechanisms, and electrical brain stimulation to better understand brain-behavior causal links. More recently, I've been applying computational modeling to determine the exact components underlying task selection. The long-term objective of my research is to understand the factors that limit flexibility to better inform treatments for psychopathology and to maximize flexibility in healthy individuals.",Associate Professor||Associate Professor,Texas A&M Institute for Neuroscience,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/na5b2b1b2

Laura,Smith,Assistant Professor,"I am interested in the molecular and circuit mechanisms of complex behavior and how alterations in synaptic connectivity between neurons lead to the maladaptive features of neuropsychiatric illnesses. Impairments in synaptic pruning are observed in autism spectrum disorders and may contribute to symptoms such as sensory hypersensitivity and social overstimulation. Repeated exposure to drugs of abuse also alters synapses in brain reward regions, and addiction-related synaptic and behavioral changes, similar to learning and memory, require the synthesis, or translation, of proteins in their local vicinity. Together these findings suggest that addiction is promoted and sustained through the coercion of normal plasticity mechanisms. Thus, investigating the function of developmental proteins in the adult brain, with regard to psychiatric and substance-related disorders, may reveal novel therapeutic and preventative strategies.",Assistant Professor,Neuroscience and Experimental Therapeutics,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/na60823cc

In particular, we are interested in allosteric regulation of enzyme activity. Consequently, we are interested in understanding the nature of the conformational change in proteins that can be effected by the binding of ligands, and specifically how these changes alter the catalytic behavior of enzymes subject to allosteric regulation. We endeavor to investigate properties that are complementary to those determined by x-ray crystallography in order to develop a comprehensive picture of the structure-function relationships involved in the regulatory phenomenon. For example, we are interested in how the dynamics of protein structure might dictate the nature of an allosteric effect. Techniques and approaches that we use in the laboratory include analysis of enzyme kinetics; analysis of the thermodynamics of enzyme-ligand interactions; time-resolved and steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy; analysis of the effects of temperature and hydrostatic pressure (up to 4 kbar) on enzyme properties, site-specific mutagenesis, isothermal titration calorimetry, and molecular graphics.",Professor and Head,Biochemistry and Biophysics,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/na6e2a0db

Frank,Raushel,Distinguished Professor,"Enzymes catalyze a remarkable variety of chemical reactions with extremely high rate enhancements and very selective substrate specificity. The research efforts in our laboratory are directed towards a more complete understanding of the fundamental principles involved in enzyme-catalyzed chemistry and the dependence on protein structure. The pursuit of this information will provide the framework for the rational and combinatorial redesign of these complex molecules in an effort to exploit and develop the properties of enzyme active sites for a variety of chemical, biological, and medicinal uses. The techniques that we are using to solve these problems include steady-state and stopped-flow kinetics, NMR and EPR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and the synthesis of inhibitors and suicide substrates. We are also using recombinant DNA methods to construct new proteins with novel catalytic properties. These efforts are currently being directed to the reactions catalyzed by phosphotriesterase and enzymes involves in the degradation of lignin and the metabolism of novel carbohydrates from the human gut microbiome.<br /><br /><br /><br />The phosphotriesterase enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of organophosphate insecticides and other toxic organophosphate nerve agents. We have discovered that the active site of this protein consists of a unique binuclear metal center for the activation of water. We are now investigating the structure and properties of this metal center as a model system for the evolution of enzyme structure and function. Toward this end we have mutated the active site of this enzyme in a research project to create novel enzymes with the ability to detect, destroy, and detoxify various chemical warfare agents such as sarin, soman, and VX. The Raushel laboratory is also engaged in a large scale research project that is focused on the development of novel strategies for the discovery of new enzymes.",Distinguished Professor,Chemistry,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/na84f2fec

Timothy,Dellapenna,Professor,"My research broadly focuses on the geological record of sedimentary processes within coastal environments, including: <br /><br /><br /><br />1)	Estuarine river mouth processes, export, and shelf dispersal- with a focus on the Brazos River.  This has so far resulted in five published papers, three separate NSF RAPID awards (2015, 2017, 2022), and one funded NSF Grant focusing on suspended sediment as nucleation for carbonate precipitation (Wurgraft et al., 2021).  Ongoing research is focused on inter-basin sediment exchange between the Brazos and San Bernard Rivers along the coastal zone at the request of the Texas General Land Office, in collaboration with Civil Engineering at UT Arlington and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  Other work includes an NSF Funded RAPID cruise to Prince William Sound and the Copper River (2012-2013) and the dispersal of the Copper River sediment in Prince William Sound, AK (Williams et al., 2018; Kuehl et al., 2017).<br /><br /><br /><br />2) Estuaries in the Anthropocene- this has included numerous studies in Galveston Bay and other estuaries along the Gulf Coast and South Korea.  In the Galveston Bay system, recent work has focused mainly on the role anthropogenically driven subsidence has played in archiving contaminants in the bay (Al MuKaimi et al., 2019A&B; Lopez et al., 2021) and how this influenced sediment and contaminants dispersal resulting from the impact of Hurricane Harvey.  This has produced a series of 5 publications in disciplines ranging from mercury dispersal (Dellapenna et al., 2020, and 2022), PAH dispersal (Camargo et al., 2021), the impact on oysters (Du et al., 2021), and hydrodynamic modeling and sedimentary responses (Du et al., 2019).  Additional work in Galveston Bay has resulted in quantifying the age and residence times of suspended sediment (Schmidt et al., 2021) and how sediment dynamics is controlling siltation within the navigational channels, which has resulted in a series of U.S. Army Corps of Engineer collaborations and funded research projects.  Most recently, we have been funded by NSF to investigate the delivery of forever contaminants (PFAS) in the Florida estuaries due to Hurricane Ian and the sediment flux of microplastics in Matagorda Bay (Matagorda Bay Mitigation Trust).  <br /><br />Internationally, my research program has been investigating the impact of estuarine dams on sediment dispersal in Korea- (William's Ph.D.,2014 and Alarcon MARM thesis).  Collaboration with Dr. Guan-hong Lee (Inha Univ.) has led to five published papers.  We have worked on the four largest river systems in Korea (Han, Nakdong, Yeongsan, and Geum Rivers).  I recently started work on a new grant by KFAS, the Kuwaiti version of NSF, to begin a new collaboration with my former graduate student, Dr. Al Mukaimi, to investigate sediment and mercury dispersal in Kuwait Bay.  This will be the first investigation into modern sedimentary processes within Kuwait Bay with the first research trip conducted in Dec. 2022.",Professor,Marine and Coastal Environmental Science,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/na95a92db

Gregg,Wells,Associate Professor,"The general theme of the research in my laboratory is the role of protein structure in disease, particularly in neurological disease. One area of study is the structure and function of the superfamily of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels that includes nicotinic acetylcholine, serotonin 5HT3, glycine, and GABAA receptors. Members of this superfamily are involved in drug addiction and alcoholism, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease, genetic forms of epilepsy, and neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and depression. We are developing new approaches to elucidating the molecular structures of these ion channels from animals and bacteria. Cyclic nucleotide gated channels (CNGCs) are a second area of study. We are interpreting their electrophysiological properties in terms of structure and thermodynamics. Hearing is a third area of study. We are using computational models of calcium and potassium ion channels and mechanotransduction to explain electrophysiological function of cochlear hair cells.

This approach is often called people/HR/workforce analytics.<br /><br /><br /><br />Traditionally, people used survey and interviews, or gut feeling and intuition based on personal experiences to make important decisions about people. Problem is, they can be more biased and don't scale. In the modern workplace and society, we generate more rich and diverse data - texts, collaboration tools, social media, and more. <br /><br /><br /><br />I taught research methods and published many empirical articles, and still do. But I realized that traditional methods don't explain well for relational interdependence and structural influence. <br /><br /><br /><br />Data analytic methods, such as machine learning, social network analysis, text mining, and simulation provide new and very powerful ways to better understand human behaviors. In HR and Workforce Development, use of data analytics is still new. But in many leading and innovative companies, these powerful techniques are applied more in key strategic areas, such as recruiting, career development, performance management, sentiment analysis, and more.

Abu Rashid,Hasan,Professor,"I have research interests in wellbore heat transfer, transient transport processes, and wellbore/reservoir fluid flow.  My current work plan is to develop heat transfer models for subsea completion in deep water settings.  Modeling fluid temperature and pressure during shut-in, startup, or rate change is complicated by the coupled nature of these transport processes. We are using numerical and semi-analytical approaches for modeling transient flow of heat, mass, and momentum in wellbores. Future work in this area includes modeling wellbore transient heat transfer to convert wellhead pressure during water injection in unconventional formations. Analysis of warmback data to improve DTS visualization and<br /><br />interpretation is another important future research topic.  Many processes require an integrated approach to modeling fluid flow and pressure drop in both the reservoir and the wellbore.

Siegfried,Musser,Professor,"The primary focus of my laboratory is to decipher how proteins partition into different sub-compartments of the cell. Cellular membranes serve to compartmentalize biochemical reactions to specific microenvironments. Proteins cross these membranes via a diverse array of protein translocation systems, or translocons. My laboratory has investigated the detailed molecular function of three different protein transport machineries, the human nuclear pore complex (NPC) and the bacterial Sec and Tat general secretion machineries. We are a biophysics lab and our primary tools for deciphering molecular mechanisms and dynamics are super-resolution imaging and single molecule particle tracking approaches.  Our aim is to develop detailed, molecular-scale, mechanistic models of protein transport processes. We recently demonstrated 3D imaging of cargo transport through nuclear pores on the millisecond timescale with 5-15 nm precision in all three dimensions.  This will be a major tool going forward for multiple projects.   <br /><br />	In 2018, we began a new project on membrane-less organelles, which are micrometer-scale cellular structures known as biomolecular condensates (BMCs) that contain high concentrations of intrinsically disordered proteins and RNA. These BMCs are generally agreed to arise from liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), which is the spontaneous partitioning into dense and dilute phases due to favorable interactions between the separating molecules.  The high density of aggregation prone proteins in BMCs is thought to lead to the cellular inclusions found in patients with multiple neurological diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.  We are using super-resolution and single molecule methods to probe the structural and dynamic heterogeneity of condensates formed from the fused in sarcoma (FUS) protein to identify the conditions that lead to solidification of liquid condensates (phase maturation).",Professor,Cell Biology and Genetics,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nb824aefa

Matthew,Sheldon,Assistant Professor,"Our research considers fundamental questions of optical energy conversion relating to plasmonic and inorganic nanoscale materials. Our experiments are principally designed to identify and optimize unique nanoscale phenomena useful for solar energy conversion, as well as related opportunities at the intersection of nanophotonics and chemistry. We employ optical and electrical characterization techniques with high spatial and energy resolution to probe optical excitation and relaxation mechanisms in nanostructured metals and semiconductors.<br /><br /><br /><br />The current world record solar cell operates at 44.4% power conversion efficiency. Thermodynamic analyses indicate that much higher efficiency is theoretically possible. Indeed, technical challenges, rather than laws of nature, limit current solar power convertors from achieving the maximum thermodynamic efficiency of 95%. <br /><br /><br /><br />We seek to better understand how nanofabricated optoelectronic and plasmonic materials provide a route to achieve the maximum possible conversion efficiency with solid state and photoelectrochemical systems. We explore how nanostructuring materials enables systematic control of the thermodynamic parameters governing optical power conversion, enabling optimization that can shape, confine, and interconvert the energy and entropy of a radiation field. Additionally, the remarkable nanoscale tailorability of a variety of structural properties, such as electrochemical potential, can further enable novel photochemical systems with broad application beyond the scope solar energy conversion.<br /><br /><br /><br />We seek students who are interested to gain expertise in inorganic synthesis of nanocrystals with tunable electrochemical and optical structures, nanofabrication, and comprehensive characterization and modeling of optoelectronic structures.

His work is particularly focused on the intersections of philosophical inquiry and literary writing. His first book, Poetics and the Gift: Reading Poetry from Homer to Derrida is forthcoming with Edinburgh University Press (2022). In it, he diagnoses the Western poetic tradition's determinative association of poetry with giving. In readings that span the classical period up through twenty-first century conceptual poetics, the book argues that the gift represents at one and the same time poetry's most extreme aneconomic privilege and the point of its closest contact with the interested exchange of the market. The gift structures poetic discourse. In this way, he argues, it remains a highly ambivalent figure that betrays poetry's longstanding investment in anthropocentric notions of exclusively human language.<br /><br /><br /><br />Dr. Rosenthal is also the editor or co-editor of three special issues of journals: ""Derrida's Classroom,"" Poetics Today 42.1 (2021), ""Geschlecht III and the Problem of 'National-Humanism',"" with Rodrigo Therezo, Pol?tica com?n 14 (2020), and ""Deconstruction and the Survival of Love,"" with Luke Donahue, Oxford Literary Review 40.2 (2018).

Lih,Kuo,Regents Professor,"My research focuses on the physiological and pathophysiological regulation of coronary and retinal microcirculation. In the circulatory system, the amount of blood delivered to each tissue can be regulated by the activity of arterial microvessels (<100  m in diameter). Changes in vascular tone, i.e., constriction or dilation of these microvessels, will decrease or increase blood supply to the tissue, respectively. However, the mechanisms involved in the regulation of vascular tone are not completely understood. Our current research focuses on the regulation of microvascular tone by hemodynamic (e.g., pressure and shear stress), metabolic (e.g., adenosine, osmolarity, K+, pH, pO2) and neural (adrenergic receptors) factors. To have an integrative view on the flow regulation, this basic information are reconstructed using mathematical model and computer simulation technology.

The focus of my art-based research is to develop a series of digital and interactive artworks that engage the viewer with the discourses of humanism versus technicism by immersing the viewers into a multisensory interactive space. Interdisciplinary at its core, the project engages scientific, medical and technology-based research and imaging in the fields of human anatomy, perception, neurology and computer science. It uses concepts of artificial intel?ligence and medical imaging as source material for artwork that consists of digital images, sculptures and interactive installations. The digital paintings, interactive sculptures as well as the interactive and Virtual Reality (VR) installations explore the confluence of human body, science and technology to further enquire and attempt to answer the question: ""What is the Human?""",Instructional Assistant Professor,Visualization,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nbf46aa45

Lacey,Luense,Assistant Professor,"Dr. Luense's research focus is understating the epigenetic regulation of the paternal genome, how it directly affects male fertility, and how it ultimately influences embryonic development and developmental programming. The paternal epigenome is likely to be a key mechanistic driver of male infertility, largely due to the unique chromatin organization of mammalian sperm that is achieved by replacing over 90% of nucleosomes (composed of histone proteins) with protamines. During this process the male germ cell undergoes histone hyperacetylation to ""loosen"" and open the chromatin structure leading to subsequent eviction of nucleosomes. The location of retained nucleosomes in sperm remains unclear, with several genomic sequencing studies pointing to different locations. Importantly, abnormal nucleosome retention and protamine insufficiency are correlated with male infertility, although the underlying mechanism - whether this is due to excess histones or aberrantly packaged DNA - has not yet been elucidated. Thus, in spite of its likely profound importance, the requirement and role of specific nucleosome retention is still poorly understood and remains to be explicitly tested.",Assistant Professor,Animal Science,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nc3bcc71e

Cynthia,Werner,Associate Dean for Faculty Affairs,"Social Networks, Gifts, and Bribes<br /><br />I conducted 24 months of fieldwork in a rural region of southern Kazakhstan during the initial post-Soviet transition. I argue that rural households coped with market dynamics by maintaining strong household networks through regular exchanges of gifts and labor, and that these networks should be regarded as a key aspect of their household survival strategy. I also describe the ubiquity of ""gifts"" and ""bribes"" in Kazakhstan, and argued that some ""gifts"" function in part as ""bribes.""  <br /><br />Women in Central Asia<br /><br />In addition to writing about the lives of rural merchant women, I have written about bride kidnapping, one of the ""hot"" gender topics for this region. I argue that this practice increased in frequency after the fall of the Soviet Union (with the rise of nationalism, corruption, and economic disruption). I also argue how discourses of shame and tradition play a role in perpetuating non-consensual bride kidnapping. <br /><br />Nuclear Testing, Radiation Victims, and Radioactive Waste<br /><br />This research project includes interviews with three groups: rural residents living near the site, medical doctors, and nuclear scientists at Kazakhstan's National Nuclear Center. We argue that these groups have very different understandings of radiation's impact on human health.  Our research also looks at how memories and narratives of nuclear testing have been shaped by the politics of aid and nation-building projects in the present. <br /><br />Kazakhstan's Repatriation Program<br /><br />Since the early 1990s, nearly half of Mongolia's Kazakh population has migrated to Kazakhstan through a government repatriation program. We argue that women are more likely than men to experience significant geographical separations from kin due to cultural preferences for exogamy and patrilocal residence. We also argue that citizenship policies for repatriated Kazakhs have shifted over time, reflecting an inherent tension between neo-liberal and nation-building projects.",Professor of Anthropology and Associate Dean for Faculty Affairs,College of Arts and Sciences,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nc3cd48e6

Paul,Lindahl,Professor,"One of our two current research areas involves iron metabolism in mitochondria. The iron imported into these organelles is assembled into iron-sulfur clusters and heme prosthetic groups. Some of these centers are exported into the cytosol, while others are installed into mitochondrial apo-proteins. All of these processes are regulated in healthy cells, but various genetic mutations giving rise to diseases can cause iron to accumulate (e.g. Friedreich's ataxia) or become depleted (e.g. Sideroblastic anemia). We have developed a biophysical approach involving Mossbauer, electron paramagnetic resonance, and electronic absorption spectroscopy, to study the entire iron content of intact mitochondria in healthy and genetically altered cells. This Systems Biology approach allows us to characterize the ""iron-ome"" of mitochondria at an unprecedented level of detail. We are also using analytical tools (e.g. liquid chromatography) to identify complexes that are involved in ""trafficking"" iron into and out of the organelle.<br /><br /><br /><br />Our other research area involves mathematical modeling of cellular self-replication on the mechanistic biochemical level. We collaborate on this multidisciplinary NSF-sponsored project with a mathematician at the University of Houston (Professor Jeffrey Morgan). We have developed a modeling framework that facilitates such modeling efforts, and have designed a number of very simple and symbolic in silico cells that exhibit self-replicative behavior. Our minimal in silico cell model includes just 5 components and 5 reactions. A second generation model includes a more realistic mechanism of mitotic regulation. One novel aspect of our approach is that cellular concentration dynamics impact (and are impacted by) cellular geometry. By minimizing membrane bending energies, we are now calculating cell geometry during growth and division.

Shiqing,Xu,Research Associate Professor,"Our research aims to develop innovative synthetic methodologies and therapeutic approaches, and apply them to solving pressing problems of biological and medical importance. New synthetic methodologies and strategies (e.g. non-traditional disconnections and C-H functionalization) have great impacts on the discovery of transformational medicines by enabling the rapid and efficient synthesis of novel, diverse, and complex biologically active molecules. New therapeutic approaches (e.g. targeted covalent inhibition and targeted protein degradation) provide new opportunities to address traditionally ""undruggable"" disease targets.<br /><br /><br /><br />We anticipate that the combination of the efforts in the development of novel synthetic methodologies and therapeutic approaches will advance drug discovery in diseases of unmet need, and achieve the research goal of identifying small-molecule probes and drug candidates that specifically remove/inhibit disease-causing proteins in cells and animal models and ultimately impact human health. Representative research directions include:<br /><br /><br /><br />1. COVID-19 drug discovery via small-molecule-induced targeted protein inhibition and degradation<br /><br />2.

Sharon,Dormire,Professor,"The overall focus of my program of research is reproductive health promotion for women. Specifically, my work explores menopausal hot flashes as a result of estrogen related changes in brain glucose metabolism. Although menopausal hot flashes (HF) have long been assumed to be benign, albeit uncomfortable, emerging evidence links higher rates of HF with both cognitive decline and cardiac disease. Understanding these associations is challenging because the physiology of the HF, is not well described.  It is commonly believed that either endocrine or thermoregulatory events in the hypothalamus are the trigger.  However, emerging evidence indicates that HF are complex and multi-causal reflecting a combination of endocrine, genetic, cultural, dietary, physical and individual factors. Building on studies of the neuroprotective effects of estrogen, we propose impaired glucose deliver hypothesis. Mediated by estradiol, neuronal activation stimulates neurobarrier coupling increasing production of glucose transporter 1 and causing vasodilation. These changes are examined as the basis of the HF ultimately leading to cognitive change at menopause. Next steps in this work are to identify reliable methods to induce HF in symptomatic women and image using PET technology the bioenergetics of glucose transport and metabolism both during the HF and without it.",Associate Dean for Undergraduate Nursing Education||Professor,School of Nursing||School of Nursing,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nd08ea40b

Kristan,Poirot,Associate Professor,"Dr. Kristan Poirot engages the concerns of contemporary feminist theorists, rhetoricians, and historians by examining the circulation of sex, gender, and race identifications in U.S. contexts that span from the nineteenth century onward. In her work, Poirot examines number of different rhetorical sites to better understand the situatedness of these identifications. She pays particular attention to social movement rhetorics and public memories about resistance and white heteronormative male supremacy.  Her focus on place and context enables a feminist intervention that grapples with both the conceptual and material entailments of sex, gender, and racial disparity.",Associate Professor||Associate Professor,Department of Communication & Journalism||Women & Gender Studies,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nd4d220b0

Lawrence,Griffing,Associate Professor,"I am testing the theory that the endoplasmic reticulum, ER is the circulatory network of the cell, connecting different organelles to each other, allowing them to share signals, lipids, and proteins.<br /><br /><br /><br />I am particularly interested in how the cytoskeletal system of plants regulates the movement of the ER network. In interphase, the actinomyosin network drives movement of the ER, just as it drives the movement organelles through the cytoplasm in a process called cytoplasmic streaming, a phenomenon in plants, but not animal cells.  Of the seventeen different myosin forms in plants, only six are involved in active cytoplasmic streaming. We are sorting out which of those six guide the different movements of the endoplasmic reticulum.<br /><br /><br /><br />I am also interested in the nature of the nexus between the ER and other organelles, including the chloroplast, plasma membrane, and Golgi.  I have recently shown that by photo-stimulating the nexus between the chloroplast and the ER, the directional flow within the ER can be reversibly altered.  This ability to generate very localized ER stress may have application in a wide variety of fields - from finding cures for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's syndrome to developing crops that can better-tolerate physiological heat stress and drought.<br /><br /><br /><br />Finally, I recently founded the company, Griffing Biologics LLC, which is based on the discovery of a novel, non-toxic pre-emergent herbicide that interferes with plant sterol metabolism.  Other work examining the uptake of sterols indicates that it may get into the plant cells via plasma membrane-ER contact sites.

Debdeep,Pati,Associate Professor,"My research centers around methodological aspects of Bayesian statistics and its application to large scale complex data. I am particularly focused on developing methodology in a broad range of areas including semi-parametric density regression, shrinkage priors for anisotropic function estimation, variable selection with non-Gaussian errors, massive covariance matrix estimation, surface reconstruction and imaging and modeling shapes of non-Euclidean objects. I enjoy developing methodology that has an immediate motivation and impact to a particular application area, while being broadly applicable and leading to foundational questions. In the Bayes paradigm this often involves developing new classes of flexible prior distributions for densities, conditional densities, functions, sparse vectors, matrices or tensors. It is fascinating to explore the structure of the spaces on which the priors are supported while studying how the posterior concentrates as increasing amounts of data are collected. Studying these spaces becomes more challenging outside of unconstrained Euclidean spaces, such as in studying closed surfaces and other shapes, and when the dimension explodes. While Bayesian hierarchical models offer an unified and coherent framework for structured modeling and inference, two key challenges persist. First, as one moves away from simple parametric models, understanding properties of a posterior distribution poses a stiff challenge. Second, even if the true posterior has desirable properties, sampling from the posterior distribution in large scale problems commonly face scalability issues. This is relevant both for high-dimensional and big data problems. My research aims at addressing these challenges simultaneously, developing new theory to evaluate the associated procedures and developing scalable and highly efficient algorithms for Bayesian computation.",Associate Professor,Statistics,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/ndbea61f5

Rita,Moyes,Instructional Associate Professor,"he immune system is a defense mechanism that has evolved in vertebrates to protect them from invading pathogens and cancer. The study of the immune system in the context of host - parasite interactions has been the focus of my studies. Generation of an effective immune response involves two major cell types: lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells. Lymphocytes confer the attributes of specificity, diversity, memory, self/nonself recognition to the immune system. Lymphocytes can be divided into two cell types: B cells which are responsible for antibody production and T cells which elaborate cytokines. Cytokines are proteins that regulate the intensity and duration of the immune response by exerting a variety of effects on lymphocytes and other immune cells. This complex network of cells and cell products have numerous mechanisms yet to be characterized.<br /><br /><br /><br />I am currently involved in the production of monoclonal antibodies to various proteins of interest in the research of the Biology faculty. Using the chicken model, my recent research has focused on the identification and characterization of various cytokines which potentiate the innate immune responses of poultry that effectively prevent organ invasion by Salmonella. Previous studies have involved the use of a mouse tumor model to evaluate various cytokine treatments for tumor reduction. The goal was to reduce cytokine toxicity which is seen with large doses while effectively reducing tumor growth.<br /><br /><br /><br />I have also studied the human T cell response to Schistosoma mansoni, an intestinal parasite, by utilizing human T cell clones.",Instructional Associate Professor,Biology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/ndc57e124

Ligands interact with the periplasmic receptor domain of a chemotactic signal transducer that spans the cell membrane.

Deborah,Siegele,Associate Professor,"Phenotypes are observable characteristics of an organism that result from the expression of a particular genotype in a particular environment. Examples of phenotypic traits in microbes are motility, sporulation, ability to perform anaerobic respiration, and resistance/sensitivity to an antibiotic. <br /><br /><br /><br />Until recently, phenotypic information has been captured as free text descriptions in research papers. Ambiguities in natural language confound attempts to retrieve information across sources. For example, ""serotype"" and ""serovar"" both refer to the same phenotype, but a simple text-based query with either word alone would miss the other. Or a single term, such as ""sporulation"" is used to refer to multiple, distinct processes in different organisms. Issues such as these hamper the ability to integrate different phenotypic data sets for the same organism or to use phenotypic information in one organism to predict possible phenotypes in another organism. Ideally, phenotype information should be stored in a consistent, computable format for ease of data integration and mining. <br /><br /><br /><br />Controlled vocabularies are used to provide both consistent terminology and a structured data format for the capture of biological information. Ontologies are controlled vocabularies of defined terms with unique identifiers and precise relationships to each other. There are phenotype ontologies available for many eukaryotic organisms, including fungi. However, when the OMP project was initiated, none of the existing ontologies was appropriate to comprehensively capture phenotypes for Bacteria or Archaea or to enable comparisons across microbial taxa.<br /><br /><br /><br />The Siegele lab and our collaborators at TAMU and the Univ. of Maryland (IGS) are developing a formal Ontology of Microbial Phenotypes (OMP). Our lab is focused on term development and annotating microbial phenotypes. OMP can be accessed at microbialphenotypes.org.

Janet,Bluemel,Professor,"Major research interests in my group include (1) immobilized catalysts, (2) the surface chemistry of oxide materials and (3) solid-state NMR spectroscopy.<br /><br /><br /><br />Immobilized catalysts (1) allow the advantages of heterogeneous catalysts to be combined with those of homogeneous catalysts. In particular, surface-immobilized homogeneous catalysts are easy to recycle, and can be highly active and selective. Furthermore they are amenable to systematic design. We find the most interesting results when heterobimetallic systems, such as the Sonogashira Pd/Cu catalyst for the coupling of aryl halides and terminal alkynes, are involved. Effective immobilization requires a thorough understanding of the surface chemistry of the oxide support materials (2). Therefore, we investigate not only the reactivity of metal complexes and linkers, but also their mobility on the surfaces. <br /><br /><br /><br />The most powerful analytical tool for investigating amorphous materials is solid-state NMR spectroscopy (3). We optimized this method especially for surface-bound species, enabling us to study reactions on surfaces, or analyze the nature of our anchored linkers and catalysts.<br /><br /><br /><br />These different research areas provide my students with a strong multidisciplinary background, spanning from synthetic chemistry, through materials sciences and catalysis, to surface analytical methods including solid-state NMR spectroscopy.

Cedric,Geoffroy,Assistant Professor,"The main focus of the laboratory is to better understand the molecular, cellular and physiological changes occurring after neurotrauma, in particular after spinal cord injury (SCI). Indeed, SCI is the second cause of paralysis, following close behind stroke. But besides the direct locomotor impairments, SCI also leads to numerous health complications, including metabolic syndrome, respiratory and cardiovascular problems. These health complications not only threaten patients' lives, but also impact their quality of life. Therefore, one major aim in my lab is to better understand the physiopathology of the SCI and health complications occurring after chronic SCI (in mouse models of SCI). Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we aim at finding targets that can reduce incidence of these health issues as well as reverse them in more chronic models.<br /><br /><br /><br />The second goal of my lab is to understand how age impacts SCI. Indeed, SCI increasingly afflicts the middle-aged population, as a result of both later average incidence (from ~29 in the 1970s to ~42 since 2010) and aging of SCI-paralyzed patients (~75% of people with SCI are over 40 years old). Recently, we demonstrated that axon regeneration is impaired after injury in older animals. This decline in axon growth can be controlled by both neuronal intrinsic and extrinsic factors. By better understanding the players involved in this age-dependent growth decline, we aim at finding targets to promote axon growth after SCI and ultimately promote locomotor function recovery in the middle-aged population.",Assistant Professor,Neuroscience and Experimental Therapeutics,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/ne49dfc75

Tumor cells lodged in nodes acquire significant vulnerabilities that enable them to evade therapy. In addition, expansion of the vasculature near the primary tumor bed activates multiple pathways that induce lymphangiogenesis and angiogenesis. The primary research focus of my laboratory is to determine how an inflammatory tumor-lymphatic microenvironment contributes to cancer metastasis and progression by reprograming molecular pathways in a) primary tumor niche and b) metastatic tumor draining LNs. We use tumor-LEC 3D spheroids, orthotopic tumor models and clinical samples to evaluate the tumor-lymphatic crosstalk in different solid tumors.

Hays,Rye,Associate Professor,"A fundamental principle of biology is the use of chemical energy in the form of ATP to assemble, disassemble and alter macromolecular structure.  Specialized control proteins known as molecular chaperones are often responsible for this activity and have been recognized in recent years to be essential for regulating many aspects of cellular biology.  Using a variety of biophysical and biochemical techniques, the Rye lab focuses on three fundamental cellular processes that require molecular chaperones:  (1) protein folding (2) protein disaggregation and (3) vesicle trafficking.  In each of these cases, large quantities ATP are burned, resulting in molecular organization in the case of protein folding, and molecular disassembly and remodeling in the case of protein disaggregation and vesicle trafficking.  We are interested in understanding the detailed biophysical mechanisms that underpin these events.  Why are these processes so energetically expensive?  Are there any similarities in how the energy is used between these very different molecular processes?  Are there general principles of energy transduction in biology that can be gleaned by comparing these examples with other molecular machines, such as cytoskeletal motors?  Understanding how molecular chaperones control protein and membrane organization will provide key insights into not only basic cell biology, but will also illuminate aspects of many diseases that spring from aberrant protein and membrane dynamics.",Associate Professor,Biochemistry and Biophysics,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/ne7fb85e1

Albert,Mulenga,"Professor and Interim head, Veterinary Pathobiology","For generations ticks and tick borne diseases have had significant impact of animal health and livestock productivity around the world. In public health the effect of ticks and tick borne diseases is also tremendous. Since the 1980s when the causative agent of Lyme disease was described, numerous human tick borne diseases have been reported. In absence of effective vaccines against major tick borne diseases, prevention of animal and human tick borne disease infections relies on the use chemicals (acaricides) to kill ticks. Although acaricide based tick control methods are effective in the short-term, they do not offer a permanent solution because of serious limitations such as ticks developing resistance and contamination of the environment and the food chain. Immunization of animals against is a validated alternative tick control method. The attraction is that tick vaccines will be effective against both acaricide resistant and susceptible tick populations. The major limiting factor is the availability of effective tick vaccine targets. The tick cannot cause damage to host or transmit disease agents without successful feeding. Thus, our plan is to understand molecular mechanisms of how ticks accomplish feeding. In this way we will find targets that will be used for development of effective tick vaccines. We are currently studying the feeding physiology of the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) and the Lone Star tick (Amblyomma americanum). According to the US Centers for Disease Control, these two medically important tick species transmit a combined nine of the 14 human tick borne disease agents in the United States. Major work is on discovery and characterization of proteins that the Lone Star and the Blacklegged tick into animals every 24h through out feeding. The area of particular emphasis is to understanding roles of serine protease inhibitors (serpins) the blacklegged tick and the Lone Star tick inject into animals during feeding.

Wayne,Versaw,Professor,"Compartmentalization of metabolic pathways and other cellular functions is a hallmark of eukaryotic cells. This feature is extreme in plants due to the presence of organelles not found in most other eukaryotes - plastids. Plastids are a diverse group of interrelated organelles that perform a wide range of metabolic functions including photosynthesis, nitrogen and sulfur assimilation and the synthesis of amino acids, starch and fatty acids. These functions are coordinated with metabolic processes in the cytosol through dynamic exchange of metabolites and ions across the plastid inner envelope membrane.<br /><br /><br /><br />My lab is studying phosphate (Pi) transport processes that link the metabolic pathways in the plastid and cytosol. The concentrations of Pi in the cytosol and plastid stroma influence photosynthesis and the partitioning and storage of fixed carbon. Transporters involved in the movement of Pi across the plastid inner membrane include members of the pPT, PHT2 and PHT4 families. We are using genetics, cell biology, biochemistry and molecular physiology to investigate the function and physiological roles of these transporters. Recent findings suggest that some members of the PHT4 family are targeted to chloroplasts, whereas others function in heterotrophic plastids and one resides in the Golgi apparatus.<br /><br /><br /><br />Other projects in the lab include the genetic and biochemical characterization of Pi transport processes in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. Mutants with altered phosphate uptake properties have been isolated, and these have led to the identification of Pi transporter genes, as well as genes with putative regulatory functions.",Professor,Biology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nea6b0d01

Ryland,Young,Professor,"Most bacterial viruses (phages) cause lysis of their host cell to release the progeny virions. Large phages elaborate an enzyme (""endolysin"") to degrade the cell wall and also a small membrane protein (""holin""). The holin accumulates in the membrane and then, at a precisely scheduled time, suddenly forms a hole to allow release of endolysin through the cytoplasmic membrane to gain access to the wall. We use molecular genetics and biochemistry to study how this small protein is able to act as a molecular ""clock"" and punch holes in membranes. Small phages make single proteins which cause host lysis in a different way. This strategy is to target the host cell wall synthesis machinery; that is, the virus makes a ""protein antibiotic"" that causes lysis in the same way as antibiotics like penicillin by inhibiting an enzyme in the multi-step pathway of murein biosynthesis. Thus, when the infected cell tries to divide, it blows up, or lyses, because it can't make the new cell wall between the daughter cells. Remarkably, each of three different, small phages blocks a different step in the pathway. These small lysis proteins are models for a completely new class of antibacterial antibiotics. Also, the E. coli SlyD protein is required for this mode of lysis in one case. SlyD is a member of an ubiquitous family of proteins related to human ""immunophilins,"" the targets of immune-suppression drugs. We study SlyD to learn about the role of this class of proteins in biology.",Professor,Biochemistry and Biophysics,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nea775348

I have addressed this question by investigating mesenchymal stem cell aging in humans and progeroid mice. In my current position as Research Assistant Professor, I am exploring the effects of aging and progeria on a new in vivo model for regeneration, the mouse digit tip, which involves regeneration of bone, nail, skin and vasculature, and requires not only stem cells, but also various other cell types to interact in a well-balanced and timely manner. I have recently established that aging delays bone regeneration in this model by attenuating both osteoclast and osteoprogenitor activity, and will now examine which specific aging processes impair osteoclast and osteoprogenitor recruitment, proliferation and differentiation, with the long term goal to improve fracture healing in the elderly.",Research Assistant Professor,Veterinary Physiology and Pharmacology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nee9a7462

David,Bergbreiter,Professor,"Our group explores new chemistry related to catalysis and polymer functionalization using the tools and precepts of synthetic organic chemistry to prepare functional oligomers or polymers that in turn are used to either effect catalysis in a greener, more environmentally benign way or to more efficiently functionalize polymers. Often this involves creatively combining the physiochemical properties of a polymer with the reactivity of a low molecular weight compound to form new materials with new functions. These green chemistry projects involve undamental research both in synthesis and catalysis but has practical aspects because of its relevance to practical problems.<br /><br /><br /><br />A common theme in our catalysis studies is exploring how soluble polymers can facilitate homogeneous catalysis. Homogeneous catalysts are ubiquitously used to prepare polymers, chemical intermediates, basic chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Such catalysts often use expensive or precious metals or expensive ligands or are used at relatively high catalyst loadings. The products often contain traces of these catalysts or ligands - traces that are undesirable for esthetic reasons or because of the potential toxicity of these impurities. Both the cost of these catalysts of these issues require catalyst/product separation - separations that often are inefficient and lead to chemical waste. These processes also use volatile organic solvents - solvents that have to be recovered and separated. Projects underway in our lab explore how soluble polymers can address each of these problems. Examples of past schemes that achieve this goal in a general way as highlighted in the Figure below.<br /><br /><br /><br />We also use functional polymers to modify existing polymers. Ongoing projects involve molecular design of additives that can more efficiently modify polymers' physical properties.

Paul,Hardin,Distinguished Professor,"A diverse array of organisms including prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes, plants, and animals display daily rhythms in physiology, metabolism and/or behavior. These rhythms are not passively driven by environmental cycles of light and temperature, but are actively controlled by endogenous circadian clocks that are set by environmental cycles, keep time in the absence of environmental cues, and activate overt physiological, metabolic and behavioral rhythms at the appropriate time of day. This remarkable conservation of circadian clock function through evolution suggests that maintaining synchrony with the environment is of fundamental importance. Our understanding of the circadian clock is particularly important for human health and well-being. The clearest examples of circadian clock dysfunction are those that result in abnormal sleep-wake cycles, but clock disturbances are also associated with other ailments including epilepsy, cerebrovascular disease, depression, and seasonal affective disorder. The realization that disorders of the sleep-wake cycle such as Familial Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome can result from alterations in clock gene function underscores the clinical importance of understanding the molecular organization of the circadian system.<br /><br /><br /><br />Work in my laboratory focuses on defining the molecular mechanisms that drive circadian clock function in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. We previously found that the core timekeeping mechanism is based on core and interlocked transcriptional feedback loops. Our studies currently focus on (1) defining post-translational regulatory mechanisms that operate in the core loop to set the 24 hour period, (2) determining whether interlocked loops are important for circadian timekeeping and/or output, (3) understanding how circadian oscillator cells are determined during development, and (4) defining mechanisms that control rhythms in olfactory and gustatory physiology and behavior.",Distinguished Professor,Biology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nf27056c4

Junuthula,Reddy,Distinguished Professor and O'Donnell Foundation Chair IV,"The current research of Dr. Reddy and his group deals with refined shell theories and associated robust shell finite elements which are free of all types of locking, and nonlocal beam and plate theories using the ideas of Eringen, Mindlin, Koiter, and others (in collaboration with colleagues from China, Finland, France, India, Singapore, Spain).  He and his group has developed a thermodynamically based strain gradient elasticity theory that contains Mindlin's model as a special case. They also conceived a transformative non-parametric network based methodology to study damage and fracture in solids (GraFEA), which yields mesh independent results for fracture and its propagation and it does not require user input about the possible fracture initiation and propagation. His works on nonlocal mechanics ideas and their incorporation into structural theories to predict the bending, buckling, and vibration response (the main idea is to embed micropolarity, which brings an additional layer of kinematics through the micro-rotation degrees of freedom within a continuum model to account for the microstructural effects during deformation to study architected materials and structures) and graph-based finite elements to predict damage and fracture are receiving attention of fellow researchers around the world. His shear deformation plate and shell theories and their finite element models and the penalty finite element models of non-Newtonian fluids have been implemented into commercial finite element computer programs like ABAQUS, NISA, and HyperXtrude.",Regents Professor||Distinguished Professor||Faculty Affiliate,The Texas A&M University System||Mechanical Engineering||Energy Institute,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nf2ea2ce4

Shelley,Wachsmann,Professor,"I am fascinated by ships and the sea and how cultures interacted through them. My regional focus is mainly, although not solely, the eastern Mediterranean during its earlier formative period. The cultic use of ships--or their facsimiles--many of which never saw water beneath their hulls, intrigues me. Due to the paucity of actual shipwrecks from the times that most interest me, I have focused on the interpretation of ancient ship iconography. Around the turn of the millennium I became interested in the potential of deep-submergence archaeology.<br /><br /><br /><br />My recent field projects reflect these interests. In 2002 I directed a paleo-environmental study of three possible Phoenician anchorages in Portugal. In 2003-2006, I directed the Canadian team of a joint Canadian-Greek expedition in search of fleets lost during the Persian War in the early fifth century B.C. and in 2007-2009 I led the Danaos Project, a deep-water survey studying the Crete-to-Egypt trade route in antiquity. Following a long fascination with the culture of Easter Island, in March 2012 I organized the first maritime remote-sensing survey of the crater lake of Rano Raraku and a survey of maritime aspects of the Rapanui Culture, in collaboration with Dr. Jo Anne Van Tilburg's Easter Island Statue Project. Most recently, under the aegis of the Jaffa Cultural Heritage Project and with the goal of better understanding the maritime dimensions of the port of Jaffa, Israel, I directed The 2014 Ioppa Maritima Project, which combined a geoarchaeological/geophysical land survey together with a deep-water Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) examination of multibeam survey anomalies at depths of 50-250 meters.<br /><br /><br /><br />My fifth book (2013) deals with a wooden ship-cart model discovered in 1920 by W.M.F. Petrie at Gurob, in middle Egypt. The prototype of the Gurob model was clearly an Aegean-style galley--probably a pentakonter of a type used by both the Mycenaeans and the Sea Peoples. This model is the most detailed known representation of this galley type, for which no actual ships have been discovered. Put simply, if Helen's face launched a thousand ships, this is the most detailed existent example of that ship type.<br /><br /><br /><br />My sixth and most recent (2015) book is a short guide to seafaring on the Sea of Galilee in antiquity.",Professor,Anthropology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nf3fe0161

Richard,Gomer,Distinguished Professor,"Our laboratory is working on three areas of biomedicine, trying to move observations from basic research into the clinic. First, we are studying how the sizes of tissues and tumors are regulated, and how this can be manipulated for therapeutic purposes. As a model system, we are using the simple eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum, which allows us to combine techniques such as biochemistry, genetics, computer modeling, and cell biology to study tissue size regulation. We have found that a secreted protein as well as the unusual molecule polyphosphate are signals in negative feedback loops that inhibit Dictyostelium cell proliferation, and we are studying the signal transduction pathway to understand similar mechanisms in humans.<br /><br /><br /><br />Second, we are studying how some secreted proteins can make cells move away from the source of the signal. We found such a signal (called a chemorepellent) in Dictyostelium, and then found a similar signal in humans. We are working to understand the signal transduction pathway for both. The human signal repels neutrophils, and we found that this can be used therapeutically in mouse models of neutrophil-driven diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and acute respiratory distress syndrome.<br /><br /><br /><br />Third, we have found that a human blood protein called Serum Amyloid P (SAP) regulates a key step in the formation of scar tissue as well as the formation of the scar-like lesions in fibrosing diseases such as congestive heart failure and pulmonary fibrosis. We are studying this mechanism, and a biotech company (Promedior, now sold to Roche) we co-founded is testing SAP as a therapy for fibrosis in patients in a Phase 3 trials.",Distinguished Professor,Biology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nf41f3898

Joerg,Steiner,Professor,"My veterinary career has mainly focused on two aspects, patient care and clinically-relevant research. As a veterinary clinician and clinical teacher I am exposed to a wide variety of canine and feline patients with complex medical conditions. These patients serve as a constant source of new clinical problems that beckon to be studied further. Sometimes these studies are merely clinical, relating to characterization of an uncommon condition, diagnosis of a difficult-to-diagnose condition, or a novel therapeutic approach to a well-described condition. In other instances studies that are spurred by clinical cases are more basic-science based, utilizing state-of-the-art technologies to further evaluate the etiology or pathogenesis of a disease. In some instances, studies may provide comparative aspects related to experimental animals, such as rodents or primates, or even to human patients with similar conditions. I believe that my role as a mentor can be unique in that I can help graduate students bridge the gap between science and clinical aspects and between veterinary and human medical interests - giving us further opportunities to advance the concept of one-health.","Professor||Director, Gastrointestinal Laboratory",School of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences||Small Animal Clinical Sciences,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nf4de66a0

Jerome,Menet,Assistant Professor,"Most organisms from bacteria to humans exhibit 24-hours rhythms in their biochemistry, physiology and behavior. Best exemplified by the sleep/wake cycle, these rhythms are remarkably widespread and include in humans hormonal (e.g., melatonin, insulin, cortisol), metabolic (e.g., glucose, cholesterol), physiological and behavioral oscillations. In fact, most biological functions are rhythmic and are set to perform optimally at the most appropriate time of the day. For example, the human digestion process performs better during the day when we are supposed to eat.<br /><br /><br /><br />These circadian rhythms are generated by ""molecular clocks"", which consist of a few ""clock genes"" interacting in feedback loops, and which drive the rhythmic expression of a large number of genes, i.e. ~10% of the transcriptome in any tissues. This wide impact of clock genes in regulating gene expression is underscored by the surprisingly large number of pathologies developed by clock-deficient mice. In addition to being arrhythmic, these mice indeed develop pathologies as diverse as mania-like behaviors, learning and memory defects, depression, drug addiction, insomnia, metabolic diseases, arthropathy, hematopoiesis defects and cancers.<br /><br /><br /><br />Research in our lab aims at characterizing how circadian clocks and clock genes regulate gene expression to provide insights into how and why clock dysfuntion leads to a wide spectra of pathologies. To this end, we are using a wide-range of molecular and biochemical techniques to investigate the circadian clock function at the genome-wide level (e.g., next-generation sequencing). We are currently extending some of our recent results and focus on 1) how clock genes rhythmically regulate chromatin environment and 2) the mechanisms involved in rhythmic post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.",Assistant Professor,Biology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nf680fb91

Teleost fishes are without-a-doubt the most successful group of fishes (and probably vertebrates) on the planet currently and have colonized almost all available aquatic habitats (and even some terrestrial habitats). The morphological diversity of teleosts is unparalleled by any other group of vertebrates, ranging in size from tiny 7mm long minnows to 10meter long oar fish, and in shape from ribbon-like eels to globe-like pufferfishes.  We investigate this diversity not only to further our understanding of vertebrate anatomy in general but also to discover novel characters to advance our understanding of the phylogenetic relationships of select groups of teleost fishes.

Dae Seok,Chai,Associate Professor,"My research agenda includes three interrelated strands: (a) expatriation effectiveness, (b) leadership in diverse cultural contexts, and (c) workforce development (Training, Organization Change) in an international context. <br /><br />My first research strand focuses on cultural adjustment and developmental needs of populations on the cultural border who have been doubly marginalized by culture, ethnicity, gender, social status, or a combination of these factors. For example, international students are consistently underrepresented and report great difficulty integrating both academically and socially. To help these doubly marginalized population, I have examined relationships among their cultural adjustment, engagement, antecedents, and outcomes in U.S. and Japanese universities. The findings guide administrators to make informed decisions and policies and strategically allocate resources and help faculty and staff better understand the unique challenges facing international students to directly advise and help them. <br /><br />My second research strand focuses on leadership in diverse cultural contexts. Despite the significance of culturally embedded leadership practices, most research has implemented extant leadership theories based on western cultural contexts without critically discussing implications for the local culture. I led a collaborative research team to conduct research on leadership effectiveness in Korea. Building on these findings, I also conducted a cross-cultural study (the U.K. and Korea) and a cross-sectional comparative study (public and private sector). <br /><br />My third research strand is workforce development in an international context.  I collaboratively developed an interdisciplinary team with faculty members in STEM fields. Although research has documented the need for cultural competence, it has not been a strong focus in undergraduate STEM education. To address these needs, we developed and submitted an NSF proposal to design a global exposure undergraduate course implementing innovative learning activities and assignments.  Through this course, STEM students will learn how other countries come up with innovative engineering solutions and how cultural characteristics play critical roles in understanding and solving engineering problems. This experience will also benefit students, faculty, employers, and industry partners by engaging key stakeholders in dialogue and training around skills for a global workforce. <br /><br />These collaborations have led to multiple refereed articles, book chapters, and conference proceedings. These works also led to invitations to share the findings and implications at institutions in the U.S., Korea, and Japan. My scholarship has also been recognized internationally with awards, the Outstanding Assistant Professor Award from the University Council of Workforce Human Resource Education, the Academy of Human Resource Development (AHRD) through its Early Career Scholar Award and Cutting Edge Awards.",Associate Professor,Educational Administration and Human Resource Development,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nfbbb62f9

Ky,Pohler,Assistant Professor,"Dr. Pohler's research interest focus on understanding the physiological and molecular mechanisms that control reproductive efficiency in cattle. More specifically his lab is interested in the mechanisms that lead to embryonic and fetal mortality in cattle and development of management strategies to overcome these losses. Embryonic mortality can be classified into early (< d 28 of gestation) or late (> d 28 of gestation) depending on the exact timing at which it occurs during gestation. Reports of high fertilization rates after a single insemination (~90%), followed by pregnancy rates of 60 to 70% on d 28 in cows indicate that early embryonic mortality may be 20 to 30% in beef cows. Documented causes of early embryonic mortality range from genetic abnormalities to uterine-embryo asynchrony to failure of maternal recognition of pregnancy and this has been an area of intense investigation.  Late embryonic mortality (> d 28 of gestation) has been reported in both beef/dairy cattle and may vary from 3.2 to 42.7%.  Currently, there is very little known about the causes of late embryonic mortality. However, the economic consequences of each unit of late embryonic mortality are greater than that of early mortality. Along with the increased economic consequences, late embryonic mortality is becoming more evident in both the beef and dairy industries based on the shift to early pregnancy diagnosis (~d28-35 of gestation).",Assistant Professor,Animal Science,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nfd0f4c67

Matthew,Sachs,Professor,"Understanding the mechanisms by which upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in mRNA transcripts control gene expression is currently the major focus of my laboratory. A substantial component of this work is focused on the uORF-encoded fungal arginine attenuator peptide (AAP). The major goal of this work is to understand the mechanism by which a nascent peptide encoded by this uORF controls the movement of ribosomes on mRNA and regulates gene expression. Control mechanisms mediated by uORFs and nascent peptides exist in mammals, fungi, plants, viruses, and bacteria, but relatively little is known of the molecular details of such control. The AAP is encoded by a uORF in the 5?-leader regions of mRNAs specifying the first enzyme in fungal arginine (Arg) biosynthesis. Synthesis of the AAP rapidly reduces gene expression in response to Arg. AAP-mediated regulation is observed in vivo in both Neurospora crassa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in vitro, using fungal, plant and animal extracts. The nascent AAP causes the ribosome to stall when the concentration of Arg is high.",Professor,Biology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nfe74574c

Halbouty Chair","My research interests span topics in structural geology, mineral physics, and solid earth geophysics with emphasis placed on the mechanical properties of Earth materials and the deformation mechanisms that govern rheology. Specific research topics have addressed the<br /><br />plasticity, creep, and failure of minerals and rocks,  examining the roles of crystalline defects, grain boundaries, interfaces, and fluids in determining macroscopic behavior. Taking an experimental approach, I have examined the effects of fluids, defect chemistry, and diffusional kinetics on mechanical behavior with current studies including the deformation of carbonates,<br /><br />compactional creep of porous quartz aggregates, the role of crack healing in restrengthening rocks, and hydrolytic weakening of silicates.","Faculty Affiliate||Professor, Michel T.

Allegra,Midgette,Assistant Professor,"Dr. Midgette's research investigates the origins and social processes that support individuals in developing an understanding of justice and learning how to care for others in an inequitable and unjust world. Her work addresses two key questions: How do we come to care about each other and about justice within the family? How do we become just in the face of inequality?<br /><br /><br /><br />To investigate these questions, Dr. Midgette employs a mixed methodology that places the experiential reality of children and their families at the forefront. The long-term goal of her work is to characterize how cultural, societal, and family practice influence individual moral development, with the ultimate aim of supporting the creation of interventions that contribute to individuals' development into more caring and just individuals.",Assistant Professor,Psychological and Brain Sciences,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nfee0fd19

Reza,Sadr,Associate Professor,"Dr. Sadr research interests include experimental techniques in thermo/fluid science with a focus on Advanced Energy Efficient Systems. He has active projects in nano/micro-fluids, droplets and sprays, alternative and bio fuels, atmospheric turbulence, and super critical fluid flows. <br /><br />Dr. Sadr's Ph.D. research was on the experimental investigation of turbulent particulated coaxial jets using Molecular Tagging Velocimetry (MTV). These flow fields are of interest due to their application in coal combustion process and greenhouse gas production. He later extended his MTV expertise to study flow field inside IC engines. Dr. Sadr continued his work at the Georgia Institute of Technology on experimental methods in micro-, nano-flows and electroosmotic fluid mechanics. Micro- nano-fluidic systems, such as Lab-On-a-Chip and ?TAS, are the emerging technologies that require new understanding of the fundamental sciences in this field. His work on nano particle movement in fluids is focused on the novel techniques in particulated flow at micro and nano scale where Brownian motion is a major factor. Dr. Sadr is pioneer in development and application of nanoPIV for near wall fluid flow measurement. <br /><br />Upon joining Texas A&M, Dr. Sadr focused his attention on the Advanced Energy Efficient Systems on several fronts at the Qatar campus. He continued his work on micro/nano fluidics for bio applications and Brownian motion. Furthermore, he initiated an active research on thermo-hydraulics of super critical CO2 flows and potentials of CO2-hydrocarbon based refrigerants, with a recent support funded by Shell. He has also successfully worked with Rolls-Royce, German Aerospace Institute (DLR), and Shell Inc. for spray and combustion characterization of Gas-to-Liquid (GTL) Fuel. He is continuing his work in studying Atmospheric Surface Layer (ASL) in Qatar to characterize pollution dispersion and potential wind energy applications in this region.
